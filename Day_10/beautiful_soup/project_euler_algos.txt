It can be seen that this sequence (starting at $13$ and finishing at $1$) contains $10$ terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at $1$.
Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.

Title: Amicable Numbers
Problem 21
Question: Let $d(n)$ be defined as the sum of proper divisors of $n$ (numbers less than $n$ which divide evenly into $n$).
If $d(a) = b$ and $d(b) = a$, where $a \ne b$, then $a$ and $b$ are an amicable pair and each of $a$ and $b$ are called amicable numbers.
For example, the proper divisors of $220$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55$ and $110$; therefore $d(220) = 284$. The proper divisors of $284$ are $1, 2, 4, 71$ and $142$; so $d(284) = 220$.
Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under $10000$.

Title: Names Scores
Problem 22
Question: Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth $3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53$, is the $938$th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of $938 \times 53 = 49714$.
What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

Title: Non-Abundant Sums
Problem 23
Question: A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of $28$ would be $1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28$, which means that $28$ is a perfect number.
A number $n$ is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than $n$ and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds $n$.
As $12$ is the smallest abundant number, $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16$, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is $24$. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than $28123$ can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.
Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.

Title: Quadratic Primes
Problem 27
Question: Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:
$n^2 + n + 41$
It turns out that the formula will produce $40$ primes for the consecutive integer values $0 \le n \le 39$. However, when $n = 40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41$ is divisible by $41$, and certainly when $n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41$ is clearly divisible by $41$.
The incredible formula $n^2 - 79n + 1601$ was discovered, which produces $80$ primes for the consecutive values $0 \le n \le 79$. The product of the coefficients, $-79$ and $1601$, is $-126479$.
Considering quadratics of the form:
Find the product of the coefficients, $a$ and $b$, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of $n$, starting with $n = 0$.

Title: Poker Hands
Problem 54
Question: In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from lowest to highest, in the following way:
The cards are valued in the order:2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.
If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.
Consider the following five hands dealt to two players:
The file, poker.txt, contains one-thousand random hands dealt to two players. Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated by a single space): the first five are Player 1's cards and the last five are Player 2's cards. You can assume that all hands are valid (no invalid characters or repeated cards), each player's hand is in no specific order, and in each hand there is a clear winner.
How many hands does Player 1 win?

Title: Lychrel Numbers
Problem 55
Question: If we take $47$, reverse and add, $47 + 74 = 121$, which is palindromic.
Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,
That is, $349$ took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.
Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like $196$, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, $10677$ is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome: $4668731596684224866951378664$ ($53$ iterations, $28$-digits).
Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel numbers; the first example is $4994$.
How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?
NOTE: Wording was modified slightly on 24 April 2007 to emphasise the theoretical nature of Lychrel numbers.

$1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 {2+\frac 1 2}} = \frac {17}{12} = 1.41666 \dots$
$1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 {2+\frac 1 {2+\frac 1 2}}} = \frac {41}{29} = 1.41379 \dots$
The next three expansions are $\frac {99}{70}$, $\frac {239}{169}$, and $\frac {577}{408}$, but the eighth expansion, $\frac {1393}{985}$, is the first example where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.
In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than the denominator?

Title: Spiral Primes
Problem 58
Question: Starting with $1$ and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length $7$ is formed.
37 36 35 34 33 32 31
38 17 16 15 14 13 30
39 18  5  4  3 12 29
40 19  6  1  2 11 28
41 20  7  8  9 10 27
42 21 22 23 24 25 2643 44 45 46 47 48 49
It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that $8$ out of the $13$ numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of $8/13 \approx 62\%$.
If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length $9$ will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below $10\%$?

Title: XOR Decryption
Problem 59
Question: Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.
A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.
For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt the message.
Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable.
Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters. Using 0059_cipher.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text.

Title: Odd Period Square Roots
Problem 64
Question: All square roots are periodic when written as continued fractions and can be written in the form:
For example, let us consider $\sqrt{23}:$
If we continue we would get the following expansion:
The process can be summarised as follows:

$\quad \quad a_0=4, \frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {\sqrt{23}+4} 7=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 7$
$\quad \quad a_1=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=3+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 2$
$\quad \quad a_2=3, \frac 2 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {2(\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-4} 7$
$\quad \quad a_3=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+4)} 7=8+\sqrt{23}-4$
$\quad \quad a_4=8, \frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {\sqrt{23}+4} 7=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 7$
$\quad \quad a_5=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {7 (\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=3+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 2$

$\quad \quad a_6=3, \frac 2 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {2(\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-4} 7$
$\quad \quad a_7=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+4)} {7}=8+\sqrt{23}-4$

It can be seen that the sequence is repeating. For conciseness, we use the notation $\sqrt{23}=[4;(1,3,1,8)]$, to indicate that the block (1,3,1,8) repeats indefinitely.
The first ten continued fraction representations of (irrational) square roots are:

$\quad \quad \sqrt{2}=[1;(2)]$, period=$1$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{3}=[1;(1,2)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{5}=[2;(4)]$, period=$1$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{6}=[2;(2,4)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{7}=[2;(1,1,1,4)]$, period=$4$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{8}=[2;(1,4)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{10}=[3;(6)]$, period=$1$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{11}=[3;(3,6)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{12}=[3;(2,6)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{13}=[3;(1,1,1,1,6)]$, period=$5$

Exactly four continued fractions, for $N \le 13$, have an odd period.
How many continued fractions for $N \le 10\,000$ have an odd period?

Title: Convergents of $e$
Problem 65
Question: The square root of $2$ can be written as an infinite continued fraction.
$\sqrt{2} = 1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + ...}}}}$
The infinite continued fraction can be written, $\sqrt{2} = [1; (2)]$, $(2)$ indicates that $2$ repeats ad infinitum. In a similar way, $\sqrt{23} = [4; (1, 3, 1, 8)]$.
It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions for square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us consider the convergents for $\sqrt{2}$.
$\begin{align}
&1 + \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{3}{2} \\
&1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}} = \dfrac{7}{5}\\
&1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}} = \dfrac{17}{12}\\
&1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}}} = \dfrac{41}{29}
\end{align}$
Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for $\sqrt{2}$ are:
$1, \dfrac{3}{2}, \dfrac{7}{5}, \dfrac{17}{12}, \dfrac{41}{29}, \dfrac{99}{70}, \dfrac{239}{169}, \dfrac{577}{408}, \dfrac{1393}{985}, \dfrac{3363}{2378}, ...$
What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,$e = [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, ... , 1, 2k, 1, ...]$.
The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for $e$ are:
$2, 3, \dfrac{8}{3}, \dfrac{11}{4}, \dfrac{19}{7}, \dfrac{87}{32}, \dfrac{106}{39}, \dfrac{193}{71}, \dfrac{1264}{465}, \dfrac{1457}{536}, ...$
The sum of digits in the numerator of the $10$th convergent is $1 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 17$.
Find the sum of digits in the numerator of the $100$th convergent of the continued fraction for $e$.

Title: Diophantine Equation
Problem 66
Question: Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:
$$x^2 - Dy^2 = 1$$
For example, when $D=13$, the minimal solution in $x$ is $649^2 - 13 \times 180^2 = 1$.
It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when $D$ is square.
By finding minimal solutions in $x$ for $D = \{2, 3, 5, 6, 7\}$, we obtain the following:
Hence, by considering minimal solutions in $x$ for $D \le 7$, the largest $x$ is obtained when $D=5$.
Find the value of $D \le 1000$ in minimal solutions of $x$ for which the largest value of $x$ is obtained.

It is possible to complete the ring with four different totals: 9, 10, 11, and 12. There are eight solutions in total.
By concatenating each group it is possible to form 9-digit strings; the maximum string for a 3-gon ring is 432621513.
Using the numbers 1 to 10, and depending on arrangements, it is possible to form 16- and 17-digit strings. What is the maximum 16-digit string for a "magic" 5-gon ring?

For example, as $1$, $2$, $4$, $5$, $7$, and $8$, are all less than or equal to nine and relatively prime to nine, $\phi(9)=6$.
It can be seen that $n = 6$ produces a maximum $n/\phi(n)$ for $n\leq 10$.
Find the value of $n\leq 1\,000\,000$ for which $n/\phi(n)$ is a maximum.

Interestingly, $\phi(87109)=79180$, and it can be seen that $87109$ is a permutation of $79180$.

It can be seen that $\dfrac 2 5$ is the fraction immediately to the left of $\dfrac 3 7$.

Perhaps less well known is $169$, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link back to $169$; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist:
It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get stuck in a loop. For example,

Title: Monopoly Odds
Problem 84
Question: In the game, Monopoly, the standard board is set up in the following way:
A player starts on the GO square and adds the scores on two 6-sided dice to determine the number of squares they advance in a clockwise direction. Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square with equal probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.
In addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they proceed directly to jail.
At the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player will remain on the CC/CH square.
The heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll. For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we are interested in. We shall make no distinction between "Just Visiting" and being sent to JAIL, and we shall also ignore the rule about requiring a double to "get out of jail", assuming that they pay to get out on their next turn.
By starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39 we can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that correspond with sets of squares.
Statistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO (3.09%) = Square 00. So these three most popular squares can be listed with the six-digit modal string: 102400.
If, instead of using two 6-sided dice, two 4-sided dice are used, find the six-digit modal string.

Title: Cuboid Route
Problem 86
Question: A spider, S, sits in one corner of a cuboid room, measuring $6$ by $5$ by $3$, and a fly, F, sits in the opposite corner. By travelling on the surfaces of the room the shortest "straight line" distance from S to F is $10$ and the path is shown on the diagram.
However, there are up to three "shortest" path candidates for any given cuboid and the shortest route doesn't always have integer length.
It can be shown that there are exactly $2060$ distinct cuboids, ignoring rotations, with integer dimensions, up to a maximum size of $M$ by $M$ by $M$, for which the shortest route has integer length when $M = 100$. This is the least value of $M$ for which the number of solutions first exceeds two thousand; the number of solutions when $M = 99$ is $1975$.
Find the least value of $M$ such that the number of solutions first exceeds one million.

Title: Product-sum Numbers
Problem 88
Question: A natural number, $N$, that can be written as the sum and product of a given set of at least two natural numbers, $\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k\}$ is called a product-sum number: $N = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_k = a_1 \times a_2 \times \cdots \times a_k$.
For example, $6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 \times 2 \times 3$.
For a given set of size, $k$, we shall call the smallest $N$ with this property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers for sets of size, $k = 2, 3, 4, 5$, and $6$ are as follows.
Hence for $2 \le k \le 6$, the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers is $4+6+8+12 = 30$; note that $8$ is only counted once in the sum.
In fact, as the complete set of minimal product-sum numbers for $2 \le k \le 12$ is $\{4, 6, 8, 12, 15, 16\}$, the sum is $61$.
What is the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers for $2 \le k \le 12000$?

Title: Roman Numerals
Problem 89
Question: For a number written in Roman numerals to be considered valid there are basic rules which must be followed. Even though the rules allow some numbers to be expressed in more than one way there is always a "best" way of writing a particular number.
For example, it would appear that there are at least six ways of writing the number sixteen:
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
VIIIIIIIIIII
VVIIIIII
XIIIIII
VVVI
XVI
However, according to the rules only XIIIIII and XVI are valid, and the last example is considered to be the most efficient, as it uses the least number of numerals.
The 11K text file, roman.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains one thousand numbers written in valid, but not necessarily minimal, Roman numerals; see About... Roman Numerals for the definitive rules for this problem.
Find the number of characters saved by writing each of these in their minimal form.
Note: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain no more than four consecutive identical units.

Title: Cube Digit Pairs
Problem 90
Question: Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit ($0$ to $9$) written on it; the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes side-by-side in different positions we can form a variety of $2$-digit numbers.
For example, the square number $64$ could be formed:
In fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible to display all of the square numbers below one-hundred: $01$, $04$, $09$, $16$, $25$, $36$, $49$, $64$, and $81$.
For example, one way this can be achieved is by placing $\{0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$ on one cube and $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9\}$ on the other cube.
However, for this problem we shall allow the $6$ or $9$ to be turned upside-down so that an arrangement like $\{0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$ and $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7\}$ allows for all nine square numbers to be displayed; otherwise it would be impossible to obtain $09$.
In determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits on each cube, not the order.
But because we are allowing $6$ and $9$ to be reversed, the two distinct sets in the last example both represent the extended set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9\}$ for the purpose of forming $2$-digit numbers.
How many distinct arrangements of the two cubes allow for all of the square numbers to be displayed?

Title: Square Digit Chains
Problem 92
Question: A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.
For example,
\begin{align}
&44 \to 32 \to 13 \to 10 \to \mathbf 1 \to \mathbf 1\\
&85 \to \mathbf{89} \to 145 \to 42 \to 20 \to 4 \to 16 \to 37 \to 58 \to \mathbf{89}
\end{align}

Therefore any chain that arrives at $1$ or $89$ will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at $1$ or $89$.
How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at $89$?

Title: Arithmetic Expressions
Problem 93
Question: By using each of the digits from the set, $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, exactly once, and making use of the four arithmetic operations ($+, -, \times, /$) and brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer targets.
For example,
Note that concatenations of the digits, like $12 + 34$, are not allowed.
Using the set, $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, it is possible to obtain thirty-one different target numbers of which $36$ is the maximum, and each of the numbers $1$ to $28$ can be obtained before encountering the first non-expressible number.
Find the set of four distinct digits, $a \lt b \lt c \lt d$, for which the longest set of consecutive positive integers, $1$ to $n$, can be obtained, giving your answer as a string: abcd.

Title: Amicable Chains
Problem 95
Question: The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of $28$ are $1$, $2$, $4$, $7$, and $14$. As the sum of these divisors is equal to $28$, we call it a perfect number.
Interestingly the sum of the proper divisors of $220$ is $284$ and the sum of the proper divisors of $284$ is $220$, forming a chain of two numbers. For this reason, $220$ and $284$ are called an amicable pair.
Perhaps less well known are longer chains. For example, starting with $12496$, we form a chain of five numbers:
$$12496 \to 14288 \to 15472 \to 14536 \to 14264 (\to 12496 \to \cdots)$$
Since this chain returns to its starting point, it is called an amicable chain.

Title: Su Doku
Problem 96
Question: Su Doku (Japanese meaning number place) is the name given to a popular puzzle concept. Its origin is unclear, but credit must be attributed to Leonhard Euler who invented a similar, and much more difficult, puzzle idea called Latin Squares. The objective of Su Doku puzzles, however, is to replace the blanks (or zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each row, column, and 3 by 3 box contains each of the digits 1 to 9. Below is an example of a typical starting puzzle grid and its solution grid.
A well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved by logic, although it may be necessary to employ "guess and test" methods in order to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion over this). The complexity of the search determines the difficulty of the puzzle; the example above is considered easy because it can be solved by straight forward direct deduction.
The 6K text file, sudoku.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains fifty different Su Doku puzzles ranging in difficulty, but all with unique solutions (the first puzzle in the file is the example above).
By solving all fifty puzzles find the sum of the 3-digit numbers found in the top left corner of each solution grid; for example, 483 is the 3-digit number found in the top left corner of the solution grid above.

However, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which contains $2\,357\,207$ digits: $28433 \times 2^{7830457} + 1$.

We shall call CARE (and RACE) a square anagram word pair and specify further that leading zeroes are not permitted, neither may a different letter have the same digital value as another letter.
Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, find all the square anagram word pairs (a palindromic word is NOT considered to be an anagram of itself).

Title: Optimum Polynomial
Problem 101
Question: If we are presented with the first $k$ terms of a sequence it is impossible to say with certainty the value of the next term, as there are infinitely many polynomial functions that can model the sequence.
As an example, let us consider the sequence of cube numbers. This is defined by the generating function,$u_n = n^3$: $1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, \dots$
Suppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working on the principle that "simple is best" we should assume a linear relationship and predict the next term to be $15$ (common difference $7$). Even if we were presented with the first three terms, by the same principle of simplicity, a quadratic relationship should be assumed.
We shall define $\operatorname{OP}(k, n)$ to be the $n$th term of the optimum polynomial generating function for the first $k$ terms of a sequence. It should be clear that $\operatorname{OP}(k, n)$ will accurately generate the terms of the sequence for $n \le k$, and potentially the first incorrect term (FIT) will be $\operatorname{OP}(k, k+1)$; in which case we shall call it a bad OP (BOP).
As a basis, if we were only given the first term of sequence, it would be most sensible to assume constancy; that is, for $n \ge 2$, $\operatorname{OP}(1, n) = u_1$.
Hence we obtain the following $\operatorname{OP}$s for the cubic sequence:
Clearly no BOPs exist for $k \ge 4$.
By considering the sum of FITs generated by the BOPs (indicated in red above), we obtain $1 + 15 + 58 = 74$.
Consider the following tenth degree polynomial generating function:
$$u_n = 1 - n + n^2 - n^3 + n^4 - n^5 + n^6 - n^7 + n^8 - n^9 + n^{10}.$$
Find the sum of FITs for the BOPs.

Title: Special Subset Sums: Optimum
Problem 103
Question: Let $S(A)$ represent the sum of elements in set $A$ of size $n$. We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, $B$ and $C$, the following properties are true:
If $S(A)$ is minimised for a given $n$, we shall call it an optimum special sum set. The first five optimum special sum sets are given below.
It seems that for a given optimum set, $A = \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}$, the next optimum set is of the form $B = \{b, a_1 + b, a_2 + b, \dots, a_n + b\}$, where $b$ is the "middle" element on the previous row.
By applying this "rule" we would expect the optimum set for $n = 6$ to be $A = \{11, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24\}$, with $S(A) = 117$. However, this is not the optimum set, as we have merely applied an algorithm to provide a near optimum set. The optimum set for $n = 6$ is $A = \{11, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25\}$, with $S(A) = 115$ and corresponding set string: 111819202225.
Given that $A$ is an optimum special sum set for $n = 7$, find its set string.

Question: Let $S(A)$ represent the sum of elements in set $A$ of size $n$. We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, $B$ and $C$, the following properties are true:
For example, $\{81, 88, 75, 42, 87, 84, 86, 65\}$ is not a special sum set because $65 + 87 + 88 = 75 + 81 + 84$, whereas $\{157, 150, 164, 119, 79, 159, 161, 139, 158\}$ satisfies both rules for all possible subset pair combinations and $S(A) = 1286$.

Surprisingly, out of the $25$ possible subset pairs that can be obtained from a set for which $n = 4$, only $1$ of these pairs need to be tested for equality (first rule). Similarly, when $n = 7$, only $70$ out of the $966$ subset pairs need to be tested.

Title: Darts
Problem 109
Question: In the game of darts a player throws three darts at a target board which is split into twenty equal sized sections numbered one to twenty.
The score of a dart is determined by the number of the region that the dart lands in. A dart landing outside the red/green outer ring scores zero. The black and cream regions inside this ring represent single scores. However, the red/green outer ring and middle ring score double and treble scores respectively.
At the centre of the board are two concentric circles called the bull region, or bulls-eye. The outer bull is worth 25 points and the inner bull is a double, worth 50 points.
There are many variations of rules but in the most popular game the players will begin with a score 301 or 501 and the first player to reduce their running total to zero is a winner. However, it is normal to play a "doubles out" system, which means that the player must land a double (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their final dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total to one or lower means the score for that set of three darts is "bust".
When a player is able to finish  on their current score it is called a "checkout" and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble 20s and double bull).
There are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6:
Note that D1 D2 is considered different to D2 D1 as they finish on different doubles. However, the combination S1 T1 D1 is considered the same as T1 S1 D1.
In addition we shall not include misses in considering combinations; for example, D3 is the same as 0 D3 and 0 0 D3.
Incredibly there are 42336 distinct ways of checking out in total.
How many distinct ways can a player checkout with a score less than 100?

Title: Primes with Runs
Problem 111
Question: Considering $4$-digit primes containing repeated digits it is clear that they cannot all be the same: $1111$ is divisible by $11$, $2222$ is divisible by $22$, and so on. But there are nine $4$-digit primes containing three ones:
$$1117, 1151, 1171, 1181, 1511, 1811, 2111, 4111, 8111.$$
We shall say that $M(n, d)$ represents the maximum number of repeated digits for an $n$-digit prime where $d$ is the repeated digit, $N(n, d)$ represents the number of such primes, and $S(n, d)$ represents the sum of these primes.
So $M(4, 1) = 3$ is the maximum number of repeated digits for a $4$-digit prime where one is the repeated digit, there are $N(4, 1) = 9$ such primes, and the sum of these primes is $S(4, 1) = 22275$. It turns out that for $d = 0$, it is only possible to have $M(4, 0) = 2$ repeated digits, but there are $N(4, 0) = 13$ such cases.
In the same way we obtain the following results for $4$-digit primes.
For $d = 0$ to $9$, the sum of all $S(4, d)$ is $273700$.
Find the sum of all $S(10, d)$.

Question: Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, $134468$.
Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, $66420$.
We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a "bouncy" number; for example, $155349$.
Clearly there cannot be any bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just over half of the numbers below one-thousand ($525$) are bouncy. In fact, the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers first reaches $50\%$ is $538$.
Surprisingly, bouncy numbers become more and more common and by the time we reach $21780$ the proportion of bouncy numbers is equal to $90\%$.
Find the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers is exactly $99\%$.

Title: Non-bouncy Numbers
Problem 113
Question: Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, $134468$.
Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, $66420$.
We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a "bouncy" number; for example, $155349$.
As $n$ increases, the proportion of bouncy numbers below $n$ increases such that there are only $12951$ numbers below one-million that are not bouncy and only $277032$ non-bouncy numbers below $10^{10}$.
How many numbers below a googol ($10^{100}$) are not bouncy?

Title: Counting Block Combinations I
Problem 114
Question: A row measuring seven units in length has red blocks with a minimum length of three units placed on it, such that any two red blocks (which are allowed to be different lengths) are separated by at least one grey square. There are exactly seventeen ways of doing this.
How many ways can a row measuring fifty units in length be filled?
NOTE: Although the example above does not lend itself to the possibility, in general it is permitted to mix block sizes. For example, on a row measuring eight units in length you could use red (3), grey (1), and red (4).

Title: Counting Block Combinations II
Problem 115
Question: NOTE: This is a more difficult version of Problem 114.
A row measuring $n$ units in length has red blocks with a minimum length of $m$ units placed on it, such that any two red blocks (which are allowed to be different lengths) are separated by at least one black square.
Let the fill-count function, $F(m, n)$, represent the number of ways that a row can be filled.
For example, $F(3, 29) = 673135$ and $F(3, 30) = 1089155$.
That is, for $m = 3$, it can be seen that $n = 30$ is the smallest value for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.
In the same way, for $m = 10$, it can be verified that $F(10, 56) = 880711$ and $F(10, 57) = 1148904$, so $n = 57$ is the least value for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.
For $m = 50$, find the least value of $n$ for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.

Title: Red, Green or Blue Tiles
Problem 116
Question: A row of five grey square tiles is to have a number of its tiles replaced with coloured oblong tiles chosen from red (length two), green (length three), or blue (length four).
If red tiles are chosen there are exactly seven ways this can be done.
If green tiles are chosen there are three ways.
And if blue tiles are chosen there are two ways.
Assuming that colours cannot be mixed there are $7 + 3 + 2 = 12$ ways of replacing the grey tiles in a row measuring five units in length.
How many different ways can the grey tiles in a row measuring fifty units in length be replaced if colours cannot be mixed and at least one coloured tile must be used?

We shall define $a_n$ to be the $n$th term of this sequence and insist that a number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.

For example, if $a = 7$ and $n = 3$, then $r = 42$: $6^3 + 8^3 = 728 \equiv 42 \mod 49$. And as $n$ varies, so too will $r$, but for $a = 7$ it turns out that $r_{\mathrm{max}} = 42$.

Title: Disc Game Prize Fund
Problem 121
Question: A bag contains one red disc and one blue disc. In a game of chance a player takes a disc at random and its colour is noted. After each turn the disc is returned to the bag, an extra red disc is added, and another disc is taken at random.
The player pays £1 to play and wins if they have taken more blue discs than red discs at the end of the game.
If the game is played for four turns, the probability of a player winning is exactly 11/120, and so the maximum prize fund the banker should allocate for winning in this game would be £10 before they would expect to incur a loss. Note that any payout will be a whole number of pounds and also includes the original £1 paid to play the game, so in the example given the player actually wins £9.
Find the maximum prize fund that should be allocated to a single game in which fifteen turns are played.

Title: Ordered Radicals
Problem 124
Question: The radical of $n$, $\operatorname{rad}(n)$, is the product of the distinct prime factors of $n$. For example, $504 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 7$, so $\operatorname{rad}(504) = 2 \times 3 \times 7 = 42$.
If we calculate $\operatorname{rad}(n)$ for $1 \le n \le 10$, then sort them on $\operatorname{rad}(n)$, and sorting on $n$ if the radical values are equal, we get:
Let $E(k)$ be the $k$-th element in the sorted $n$ column; for example, $E(4) = 8$ and $E(6) = 9$.
If $\operatorname{rad}(n)$ is sorted for $1 \le n \le 100000$, find $E(10000)$.

There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be written as consecutive square sums, and the sum of these palindromes is $4164$. Note that $1 = 0^2 + 1^2$ has not been included as this problem is concerned with the squares of positive integers.

Title: Cuboid Layers
Problem 126
Question: The minimum number of cubes to cover every visible face on a cuboid measuring $3 \times 2 \times 1$ is twenty-two.
If we then add a second layer to this solid it would require forty-six cubes to cover every visible face, the third layer would require seventy-eight cubes, and the fourth layer would require one-hundred and eighteen cubes to cover every visible face.
However, the first layer on a cuboid measuring $5 \times 1 \times 1$ also requires twenty-two cubes; similarly the first layer on cuboids measuring $5 \times 3 \times 1$, $7 \times 2 \times 1$, and $11 \times 1 \times 1$ all contain forty-six cubes.
We shall define $C(n)$ to represent the number of cuboids that contain $n$ cubes in one of its layers. So $C(22) = 2$, $C(46) = 4$, $C(78) = 5$, and $C(118) = 8$.
It turns out that $154$ is the least value of $n$ for which $C(n) = 10$.

We shall define the triplet of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ to be an abc-hit if:
For example, $(5, 27, 32)$ is an abc-hit, because:
It turns out that abc-hits are quite rare and there are only thirty-one abc-hits for $c \lt 1000$, with $\sum c = 12523$.

Title: Hexagonal Tile Differences
Problem 128
Question: A hexagonal tile with number $1$ is surrounded by a ring of six hexagonal tiles, starting at "12 o'clock" and numbering the tiles $2$ to $7$ in an anti-clockwise direction.
New rings are added in the same fashion, with the next rings being numbered $8$ to $19$, $20$ to $37$, $38$ to $61$, and so on. The diagram below shows the first three rings.
By finding the difference between tile $n$ and each of its six neighbours we shall define $PD(n)$ to be the number of those differences which are prime.
For example, working clockwise around tile $8$ the differences are $12, 29, 11, 6, 1$, and $13$. So $PD(8) = 3$.
In the same way, the differences around tile $17$ are $1, 17, 16, 1, 11$, and $10$, hence $PD(17) = 2$.
It can be shown that the maximum value of $PD(n)$ is $3$.
If all of the tiles for which $PD(n) = 3$ are listed in ascending order to form a sequence, the $10$th tile would be $271$.
Find the $2000$th tile in this sequence.

Question: A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define $R(k)$ to be a repunit of length $k$; for example, $R(6) = 111111$.
Given that $n$ is a positive integer and $\gcd(n, 10) = 1$, it can be shown that there always exists a value, $k$, for which $R(k)$ is divisible by $n$, and let $A(n)$ be the least such value of $k$; for example, $A(7) = 6$ and $A(41) = 5$.
You are given that for all primes, $p \gt 5$, that $p - 1$ is divisible by $A(p)$. For example, when $p = 41$, $A(41) = 5$, and $40$ is divisible by $5$.
However, there are rare composite values for which this is also true; the first five examples being $91$, $259$, $451$, $481$, and $703$.
Find the sum of the first twenty-five composite values of $n$ for which $\gcd(n, 10) = 1$ and $n - 1$ is divisible by $A(n)$.

Let us consider repunits of the form $R(10^n)$.
Although $R(10)$, $R(100)$, or $R(1000)$ are not divisible by $17$, $R(10000)$ is divisible by $17$. Yet there is no value of $n$ for which $R(10^n)$ will divide by $19$. In fact, it is remarkable that $11$, $17$, $41$, and $73$ are the only four primes below one-hundred that can  be a factor of $R(10^n)$.

For example, $(3, 4, 5)$ triangles can be placed together to form a $5$ by $5$ square with a $1$ by $1$ hole in the middle and it can be seen that the $5$ by $5$ square can be tiled with twenty-five $1$ by $1$ squares.
However, if $(5, 12, 13)$ triangles were used then the hole would measure $7$ by $7$ and these could not be used to tile the $13$ by $13$ square.
Given that the perimeter of the right triangle is less than one-hundred million, how many Pythagorean triangles would allow such a tiling to take place?

Title: Square Progressive Numbers
Problem 141
Question: A positive integer, $n$, is divided by $d$ and the quotient and remainder are $q$ and $r$ respectively. In addition $d$, $q$, and $r$ are consecutive positive integer terms in a geometric sequence, but not necessarily in that order.
For example, $58$ divided by $6$ has quotient $9$ and remainder $4$. It can also be seen that $4, 6, 9$ are consecutive terms in a geometric sequence (common ratio $3/2$).
We will call such numbers, $n$, progressive.
Some progressive numbers, such as $9$ and $10404 = 102^2$, happen to also be perfect squares. The sum of all progressive perfect squares below one hundred thousand is $124657$.

Title: Torricelli Triangles
Problem 143
Question: Let $ABC$ be a triangle with all interior angles being less than $120$ degrees. Let $X$ be any point inside the triangle and let $XA = p$, $XC = q$, and $XB = r$.
Fermat challenged Torricelli to find the position of $X$ such that $p + q + r$ was minimised.
Torricelli was able to prove that if equilateral triangles $AOB$, $BNC$ and $AMC$ are constructed on each side of triangle $ABC$, the circumscribed circles of $AOB$, $BNC$, and $AMC$ will intersect at a single point, $T$, inside the triangle. Moreover he proved that $T$, called the Torricelli/Fermat point, minimises $p + q + r$. Even more remarkable, it can be shown that when the sum is minimised, $AN = BM = CO = p + q + r$ and that $AN$, $BM$ and $CO$ also intersect at $T$.
If the sum is minimised and $a, b, c, p, q$ and $r$ are all positive integers we shall call triangle $ABC$ a Torricelli triangle. For example, $a = 399$, $b = 455$, $c = 511$ is an example of a Torricelli triangle, with $p + q + r = 784$.
Find the sum of all distinct values of $p + q + r \le 120000$ for Torricelli triangles.

Question: In laser physics, a "white cell" is a mirror system that acts as a delay line for the laser beam. The beam enters the cell, bounces around on the mirrors, and eventually works its way back out.
The specific white cell we will be considering is an ellipse with the equation $4x^2 + y^2 = 100$.
The section corresponding to $-0.01 \le x \le +0.01$ at the top is missing, allowing the light to enter and exit through the hole.
The light beam in this problem starts at the point $(0.0,10.1)$ just outside the white cell, and the beam first impacts the mirror at $(1.4,-9.6)$.
Each time the laser beam hits the surface of the ellipse, it follows the usual law of reflection "angle of incidence equals angle of reflection." That is, both the incident and reflected beams make the same angle with the normal line at the point of incidence.
In the figure on the left, the red line shows the first two points of contact between the laser beam and the wall of the white cell; the blue line shows the line tangent to the ellipse at the point of incidence of the first bounce.
The slope $m$ of the tangent line at any point $(x,y)$ of the given ellipse is: $m = -4x/y$.
The normal line is perpendicular to this tangent line at the point of incidence.
The animation on the right shows the first $10$ reflections of the beam.
How many times does the beam hit the internal surface of the white cell before exiting?

Title: Reversible Numbers
Problem 145
Question: Some positive integers $n$ have the property that the sum $[n + \operatorname{reverse}(n)]$ consists entirely of odd (decimal) digits. For instance, $36 + 63 = 99$ and $409 + 904 = 1313$. We will call such numbers reversible; so $36$, $63$, $409$, and $904$ are reversible. Leading zeroes are not allowed in either $n$ or $\operatorname{reverse}(n)$.
There are $120$ reversible numbers below one-thousand.
How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion ($10^9$)?

Problem 147
Question: In a $3 \times 2$ cross-hatched grid, a total of $37$ different rectangles could be situated within that grid as indicated in the sketch.
There are $5$ grids smaller than $3 \times 2$, vertical and horizontal dimensions being important, i.e. $1 \times 1$, $2 \times 1$, $3 \times 1$, $1 \times 2$ and $2 \times 2$. If each of them is cross-hatched, the following number of different rectangles could be situated within those smaller grids:
Adding those to the $37$ of the $3 \times 2$ grid, a total of $72$ different rectangles could be situated within $3 \times 2$ and smaller grids.
How many different rectangles could be situated within $47 \times 43$ and smaller grids?

Title: Maximum-sum Subsequence
Problem 149
Question: Looking at the table below, it is easy to verify that the maximum possible sum of adjacent numbers in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal or anti-diagonal) is $16$ ($= 8 + 7 + 1$).
Now, let us repeat the search, but on a much larger scale:
First, generate four million pseudo-random numbers using a specific form of what is known as a "Lagged Fibonacci Generator":
For $1 \le k \le 55$, $s_k = [100003 - 200003 k + 300007 k^3] \pmod{1000000} - 500000$.
For $56 \le k \le 4000000$, $s_k = [s_{k-24} + s_{k - 55} + 1000000] \pmod{1000000} - 500000$.
Thus, $s_{10} = -393027$ and $s_{100} = 86613$.
The terms of $s$ are then arranged in a $2000 \times 2000$ table, using the first $2000$ numbers to fill the first row (sequentially), the next $2000$ numbers to fill the second row, and so on.
Finally, find the greatest sum of (any number of) adjacent entries in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal or anti-diagonal).

Title: Sub-triangle Sums
Problem 150
Question: In a triangular array of positive and negative integers, we wish to find a sub-triangle such that the sum of the numbers it contains is the smallest possible.
In the example below, it can be easily verified that the marked triangle satisfies this condition having a sum of −42.
We wish to make such a triangular array with one thousand rows, so we generate 500500 pseudo-random numbers sk in the range ±219, using a type of random number generator (known as a Linear Congruential Generator) as follows:
t := 0

for k = 1 up to k = 500500:

    t := (615949*t + 797807) modulo 220
    sk := t−219
Thus: s1 = 273519, s2 = −153582, s3 = 450905 etc
Our triangular array is then formed using the pseudo-random numbers thus:
Sub-triangles can start at any element of the array and extend down as far as we like (taking-in the two elements directly below it from the next row, the three elements directly below from the row after that, and so on).

The "sum of a sub-triangle" is defined as the sum of all the elements it contains.

Find the smallest possible sub-triangle sum.

Title: A Preference for A5
Problem 151
Question: A printing shop runs 16 batches (jobs) every week and each batch requires a sheet of special colour-proofing paper of size A5.
Every Monday morning, the supervisor opens a new envelope, containing a large sheet of the special paper with size A1.
The supervisor proceeds to cut it in half, thus getting two sheets of size A2. Then one of the sheets is cut in half to get two sheets of size A3 and so on until an A5-size sheet is obtained, which is needed for the first batch of the week.
All the unused sheets are placed back in the envelope.
At the beginning of each subsequent batch, the supervisor takes from the envelope one sheet of paper at random. If it is of size A5, then it is used. If it is larger, then the 'cut-in-half' procedure is repeated until an A5-size sheet is obtained, and any remaining sheets are always placed back in the envelope.
Excluding the first and last batch of the week, find the expected number of times (during each week) that the supervisor finds a single sheet of paper in the envelope.
Give your answer rounded to six decimal places using the format x.xxxxxx .

Title: Sums of Square Reciprocals
Problem 152
Question: There are several ways to write the number $\dfrac{1}{2}$ as a sum of square reciprocals using distinct integers.
For instance, the numbers $\{2,3,4,5,7,12,15,20,28,35\}$ can be used:
$$\begin{align}\dfrac{1}{2} &= \dfrac{1}{2^2} + \dfrac{1}{3^2} + \dfrac{1}{4^2} + \dfrac{1}{5^2} +\\
&\quad \dfrac{1}{7^2} + \dfrac{1}{12^2} + \dfrac{1}{15^2} + \dfrac{1}{20^2} +\\
&\quad \dfrac{1}{28^2} + \dfrac{1}{35^2}\end{align}$$
In fact, only using integers between $2$ and $45$ inclusive, there are exactly three ways to do it, the remaining two being: $\{2,3,4,6,7,9,10,20,28,35,36,45\}$ and $\{2,3,4,6,7,9,12,15,28,30,35,36,45\}$.
How many ways are there to write $\dfrac{1}{2}$ as a sum of reciprocals of squares using distinct integers between $2$ and $80$ inclusive?

Title: Investigating Gaussian Integers
Problem 153
Question: As we all know the equation $x^2=-1$ has no solutions for real $x$.

If we however introduce the imaginary number $i$ this equation has two solutions: $x=i$ and $x=-i$.

If we go a step further the equation $(x-3)^2=-4$ has two complex solutions: $x=3+2i$ and $x=3-2i$.
$x=3+2i$ and $x=3-2i$ are called each others' complex conjugate.

Numbers of the form $a+bi$ are called complex numbers.

In general $a+bi$ and $a-bi$ are each other's complex conjugate.
A Gaussian Integer is a complex number $a+bi$ such that both $a$ and $b$ are integers.

The regular integers are also Gaussian integers (with $b=0$).

To distinguish them from Gaussian integers with $b \ne 0$ we call such integers "rational integers."

A Gaussian integer $a+bi$ is called a divisor of a rational integer $n$ if the result $\dfrac n {a + bi}$ is also a Gaussian integer.

If for example we divide $5$ by $1+2i$ we can simplify $\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i}$ in the following manner:

Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of $1+2i$: $1-2i$.

The result is $\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i} = \dfrac{5}{1 + 2i}\dfrac{1 - 2i}{1 - 2i} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (2i)^2} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (-4)} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{5} = 1 - 2i$.

So $1+2i$ is a divisor of $5$.

Note that $1+i$ is not a divisor of $5$ because $\dfrac{5}{1 + i} = \dfrac{5}{2} - \dfrac{5}{2}i$.

Note also that if the Gaussian Integer $(a+bi)$ is a divisor of a rational integer $n$, then its complex conjugate $(a-bi)$ is also a divisor of $n$.
In fact, $5$ has six divisors such that the real part is positive: $\{1, 1 + 2i, 1 - 2i, 2 + i, 2 - i, 5\}$.

The following is a table of all of the divisors for the first five positive rational integers:
For divisors with positive real parts, then, we have: $\sum \limits_{n = 1}^{5} {s(n)} = 35$.
$\sum \limits_{n = 1}^{10^5} {s(n)} = 17924657155$.
What is $\sum \limits_{n = 1}^{10^8} {s(n)}$?

Title: Exploring Pascal's Pyramid
Problem 154
Question: A triangular pyramid is constructed using spherical balls so that each ball rests on exactly three balls of the next lower level.
Then, we calculate the number of paths leading from the apex to each position:
A path starts at the apex and progresses downwards to any of the three spheres directly below the current position.
Consequently, the number of paths to reach a certain position is the sum of the numbers immediately above it (depending on the position, there are up to three numbers above it).
The result is Pascal's pyramid and the numbers at each level $n$ are the coefficients of the trinomial expansion 
$(x + y + z)^n$.
How many coefficients in the expansion of $(x + y + z)^{200000}$ are multiples of $10^{12}$?

Title: Counting Capacitor Circuits
Problem 155
Question: An electric circuit uses exclusively identical capacitors of the same value $C$.

The capacitors can be connected in series or in parallel to form sub-units, which can then be connected in series or in parallel with other capacitors or other sub-units to form larger sub-units, and so on up to a final circuit.
Using this simple procedure and up to $n$ identical capacitors, we can make circuits having a range of different total capacitances. For example, using up to $n=3$ capacitors of $\pu{60 \mu F}$ each, we can obtain the following $7$ distinct total capacitance values: 
If we denote by $D(n)$ the number of distinct total capacitance values we can obtain when using up to $n$ equal-valued capacitors and the simple procedure described above, we have: $D(1)=1$, $D(2)=3$, $D(3)=7$, $\dots$
Find $D(18)$.
Reminder: When connecting capacitors $C_1, C_2$ etc in parallel, the total capacitance is $C_T = C_1 + C_2 + \cdots$,

whereas when connecting them in series, the overall capacitance is given by: $\dfrac{1}{C_T} = \dfrac{1}{C_1} + \dfrac{1}{C_2} + \cdots$

Title: Counting Digits
Problem 156
Question: Starting from zero the natural numbers are written down in base $10$ like this:

$0\,1\,2\,3\,4\,5\,6\,7\,8\,9\,10\,11\,12\cdots$

Consider the digit $d=1$. After we write down each number $n$, we will update the number of ones that have occurred and call this number $f(n,1)$. The first values for $f(n,1)$, then, are as follows:
Note that $f(n,1)$ never equals $3$.

So the first two solutions of the equation $f(n,1)=n$ are $n=0$ and $n=1$. The next solution is $n=199981$.
In the same manner the function $f(n,d)$ gives the total number of digits $d$ that have been written down after the number $n$ has been written.

In fact, for every digit $d \ne 0$, $0$ is the first solution of the equation $f(n,d)=n$.
Let $s(d)$ be the sum of all the solutions for which $f(n,d)=n$.

You are given that $s(1)=22786974071$.
Find  $\sum s(d)$ for $1 \le d \le 9$.
Note: if, for some $n$, $f(n,d)=n$ for more than one value of $d$ this value of $n$ is counted again for every value of $d$ for which $f(n,d)=n$.

For $n=1$ this equation has $20$ solutions that are listed below:
\begin{matrix}
\frac 1 1 + \frac 1 1 = \frac{20}{10} & \frac 1 1 + \frac 1 2 = \frac{15}{10} & \frac 1 1 + \frac 1 5 = \frac{12}{10} & \frac 1 1 + \frac 1 {10} = \frac{11}{10} & \frac 1 2 + \frac 1 2 = \frac{10}{10}\\
\frac 1 2 + \frac 1 5 = \frac 7 {10} & \frac 1 2 + \frac 1 {10} = \frac 6 {10} & \frac 1 3 + \frac 1 6 = \frac 5 {10} & \frac 1 3 + \frac 1 {15} = \frac 4 {10} & \frac 1 4 + \frac 1 4 = \frac 5 {10}\\
\frac 1 4 + \frac 1 {20} = \frac 3 {10} & \frac 1 5 + \frac 1 5 = \frac 4 {10} & \frac 1 5 + \frac 1 {10} = \frac 3 {10} & \frac 1 6 + \frac 1 {30} = \frac 2 {10} & \frac 1 {10} + \frac 1 {10} = \frac 2 {10}\\
\frac 1 {11} + \frac 1 {110} = \frac 1 {10} & \frac 1 {12} + \frac 1 {60} = \frac 1 {10} & \frac 1 {14} + \frac 1 {35} = \frac 1 {10} & \frac 1 {15} + \frac 1 {30} = \frac 1 {10} & \frac 1 {20} + \frac 1 {20} = \frac 1 {10}

Title: Lexicographical Neighbours
Problem 158
Question: Taking three different letters from the $26$ letters of the alphabet, character strings of length three can be formed.
Examples are 'abc', 'hat' and 'zyx'.
When we study these three examples we see that for 'abc' two characters come lexicographically after its neighbour to the left. 
For 'hat' there is exactly one character that comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left. For 'zyx' there are zero characters that come lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
In all there are $10400$ strings of length $3$ for which exactly one character comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
We now consider strings of $n \le 26$ different characters from the alphabet. 
For every $n$, $p(n)$ is the number of strings of length $n$ for which exactly one character comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
What is the maximum value of $p(n)$?

Title: Digital Root Sums of Factorisations
Problem 159
Question: A composite number can be factored many different ways.  
For instance, not including multiplication by one, $24$ can be factored in $7$ distinct ways:
Recall that the digital root of a number, in base $10$, is found by adding together the digits of that number, 
and repeating that process until a number is arrived at that is less than $10$.  
Thus the digital root of $467$ is $8$.
We shall call a Digital Root Sum (DRS) the sum of the digital roots of the individual factors of our number.
The chart below demonstrates all of the DRS values for $24$.
The maximum Digital Root Sum of $24$ is $11$.
The function $\operatorname{mdrs}(n)$ gives the maximum Digital Root Sum of $n$. So $\operatorname{mdrs}(24)=11$.
Find $\sum \operatorname{mdrs}(n)$ for $1 \lt n \lt 1\,000\,000$.

Sixteen triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed in that triangle.

Title: Intersections
Problem 165
Question: A segment is uniquely defined by its two endpoints. By considering two line segments in plane geometry there are three possibilities: 
the segments have zero points, one point, or infinitely many points in common.
Moreover when two segments have exactly one point in common it might be the case that that common point is an endpoint of either one of the segments or of both. If a common point of two segments is not an endpoint of either of the segments it is an interior point of both segments.
We will call a common point $T$ of two segments $L_1$ and $L_2$ a true intersection point of $L_1$ and $L_2$ if $T$ is the only common point of $L_1$ and $L_2$ and $T$ is an interior point of both segments.

Consider the three segments $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$:
It can be verified that line segments $L_2$ and $L_3$ have a true intersection point. We note that as the one of the end points of $L_3$: $(22,40)$ lies on $L_1$ this is not considered to be a true point of intersection. $L_1$ and $L_2$ have no common point. So among the three line segments, we find one true intersection point.
Now let us do the same for $5000$ line segments. To this end, we generate $20000$ numbers using the so-called "Blum Blum Shub" pseudo-random number generator.
To create each line segment, we use four consecutive numbers $t_n$. That is, the first line segment is given by:
$(t_1, t_2)$ to $(t_3, t_4)$.
The first four numbers computed according to the above generator should be: $27$, $144$, $12$ and $232$. The first segment would thus be $(27,144)$ to $(12,232)$.
How many distinct true intersection points are found among the $5000$ line segments?

Title: Investigating Ulam Sequences

Question: For two positive integers $a$ and $b$, the Ulam sequence $U(a,b)$ is defined by $U(a,b)_1 = a$, $U(a,b)_2 = b$ and for $k \gt 2$,
$U(a,b)_k$ is the smallest integer greater than $U(a,b)_{k - 1}$ which can be written in exactly one way as the sum of two distinct previous members of $U(a,b)$.
For example, the sequence $U(1,2)$ begins with
$1$, $2$, $3 = 1 + 2$, $4 = 1 + 3$, $6 = 2 + 4$, $8 = 2 + 6$, $11 = 3 + 8$;
$5$ does not belong to it because $5 = 1 + 4 = 2 + 3$ has two representations as the sum of two previous members, likewise $7 = 1 + 6 = 3 + 4$.
Find $\sum\limits_{n = 2}^{10} U(2,2n+1)_k$, where $k = 10^{11}$.

Question: Consider the number $142857$. We can right-rotate this number by moving the last digit ($7$) to the front of it, giving us $714285$.
It can be verified that $714285 = 5 \times 142857$.
This demonstrates an unusual property of $142857$: it is a divisor of its right-rotation.
Find the last $5$ digits of the sum of all integers $n$, $10 \lt n \lt 10^{100}$, that have this property.

Title: Pandigital Concatenating Products
Problem 170
Question: Take the number $6$ and multiply it by each of $1273$ and $9854$:
By concatenating these products we get the $1$ to $9$ pandigital $763859124$. We will call $763859124$ the "concatenated product of $6$ and $(1273,9854)$". Notice too, that the concatenation of the input numbers, $612739854$, is also $1$ to $9$ pandigital.
The same can be done for $0$ to $9$ pandigital numbers.
What is the largest $0$ to $9$ pandigital $10$-digit concatenated product of an integer with two or more other integers, such that the concatenation of the input numbers is also a $0$ to $9$ pandigital $10$-digit number?

Title: Hollow Square Laminae II
Problem 174
Question: We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square "hole" so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry.
Given eight tiles it is possible to form a lamina in only one way: $3 \times 3$ square with a $1 \times 1$ hole in the middle. However, using thirty-two tiles it is possible to form two distinct laminae.
If t represents the number of tiles used, we shall say that $t = 8$ is type $L(1)$ and $t = 32$ is type $L(2)$.
Let $N(n)$ be the number of $t \le 1000000$ such that $t$ is type $L(n)$; for example, $N(15) = 832$.

Title: Fractions and Sum of Powers of Two
Problem 175
Question: Define $f(0)=1$ and $f(n)$ to be the number of ways to write $n$ as a sum of powers of $2$ where no power occurs more than twice.

For example, $f(10)=5$ since there are five different ways to express $10$:$10 = 8+2 = 8+1+1 = 4+4+2 = 4+2+2+1+1 = 4+4+1+1.$

It can be shown that for every fraction $p / q$ ($p \gt 0$, $q \gt 0$) there exists at least one integer $n$ such that $f(n)/f(n-1)=p/q$.

For instance, the smallest $n$ for which $f(n)/f(n-1)=13/17$ is $241$.
The binary expansion of $241$ is $11110001$.
Reading this binary number from the most significant bit to the least significant bit there are $4$ one's, $3$ zeroes and $1$ one. We shall call the string $4,3,1$ the Shortened Binary Expansion of $241$.

Find the Shortened Binary Expansion of the smallest $n$ for which $f(n)/f(n-1)=123456789/987654321$.

Title: Integer Angled Quadrilaterals
Problem 177
Question: Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral, with diagonals $AC$ and $BD$. At each vertex the diagonal makes an angle with each of the two sides, creating eight corner angles.

For example, at vertex $A$, the two angles are $CAD$, $CAB$.
We call such a quadrilateral for which all eight corner angles have integer values when measured in degrees an "integer angled quadrilateral". An example of an integer angled quadrilateral is a square, where all eight corner angles are $45^\circ$. Another example is given by $DAC = 20^\circ$, $BAC = 60^\circ$, $ABD = 50^\circ$, $CBD = 30^\circ$, $BCA = 40^\circ$, $DCA = 30^\circ$, $CDB = 80^\circ$, $ADB = 50^\circ$.
What is the total number of non-similar integer angled quadrilaterals?
Note: In your calculations you may assume that a calculated angle is integral if it is within a tolerance of $10^{-9}$ of an integer value.

Title: RSA Encryption
Problem 182
Question: The RSA encryption is based on the following procedure:
Generate two distinct primes $p$ and $q$.Compute $n = pq$ and $\phi = (p - 1)(q - 1)$.
Find an integer $e$, $1 \lt e \lt \phi$, such that $\gcd(e, \phi) = 1$.
A message in this system is a number in the interval $[0, n - 1]$.
A text to be encrypted is then somehow converted to messages (numbers in the interval $[0, n - 1]$).
To encrypt the text, for each message, $m$, $c = m^e \bmod n$ is calculated.
To decrypt the text, the following procedure is needed: calculate $d$ such that $ed = 1 \bmod \phi$, then for each encrypted message, $c$, calculate $m = c^d \bmod n$.
There exist values of $e$ and $m$ such that $m^e \bmod n = m$.We call messages $m$ for which $m^e \bmod n = m$ unconcealed messages.
An issue when choosing $e$ is that there should not be too many unconcealed messages.For instance, let $p = 19$ and $q = 37$.
Then $n = 19 \cdot 37 = 703$ and $\phi = 18 \cdot 36 = 648$.
If we choose $e = 181$, then, although $\gcd(181,648) = 1$ it turns out that all possible messages $m$ ($0 \le m \le n - 1$) are unconcealed when calculating $m^e \bmod n$.
For any valid choice of $e$ there exist some unconcealed messages.
It's important that the number of unconcealed messages is at a minimum.
Choose $p = 1009$ and $q = 3643$.
Find the sum of all values of $e$, $1 \lt e \lt \phi(1009,3643)$ and $\gcd(e, \phi) = 1$, so that the number of unconcealed messages for this value of $e$ is at a minimum.

Title: Maximum Product of Parts
Problem 183
Question: Let $N$ be a positive integer and let $N$ be split into $k$ equal parts, $r = N/k$, so that $N = r + r + \cdots + r$.
Let $P$ be the product of these parts, $P = r \times r \times \cdots \times r = r^k$.
For example, if $11$ is split into five equal parts, $11 = 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2$, then $P = 2.2^5 = 51.53632$.
Let $M(N) = P_{\mathrm{max}}$ for a given value of $N$.
It turns out that the maximum for $N = 11$ is found by splitting eleven into four equal parts which leads to $P_{\mathrm{max}} = (11/4)^4$; that is, $M(11) = 14641/256 = 57.19140625$, which is a terminating decimal.
However, for $N = 8$ the maximum is achieved by splitting it into three equal parts, so $M(8) = 512/27$, which is a non-terminating decimal.
Let $D(N) = N$ if $M(N)$ is a non-terminating decimal and $D(N) = -N$ if $M(N)$ is a terminating decimal.
For example, $\sum\limits_{N = 5}^{100} D(N)$ is $2438$.
Find $\sum\limits_{N = 5}^{10000} D(N)$.

Title: Number Mind
Problem 185
Question: The game Number Mind is a variant of the well known game Master Mind.
Instead of coloured pegs, you have to guess a secret sequence of digits. After each guess you're only told in how many places you've guessed the correct digit. So, if the sequence was 1234 and you guessed 2036, you'd be told that you have one correct digit; however, you would NOT be told that you also have another digit in the wrong place.
For instance, given the following guesses for a 5-digit secret sequence,

70794 ;0 correct
39458 ;2 correct
34109 ;1 correct

Title: Connectedness of a Network
Problem 186
Question: Here are the records from a busy telephone system with one million users:
The telephone number of the caller and the called number in record $n$ are $\operatorname{Caller}(n) = S_{2n-1}$ and $\operatorname{Called}(n) = S_{2n}$ where $S_{1,2,3,\dots}$ come from the "Lagged Fibonacci Generator":
For $1 \le k \le 55$, $S_k = [100003 - 200003k + 300007k^3] \pmod{1000000}$.
For $56 \le k$, $S_k = [S_{k-24} + S_{k-55}] \pmod{1000000}$.
If $\operatorname{Caller}(n) = \operatorname{Called}(n)$ then the user is assumed to have misdialled and the call fails; otherwise the call is successful.
From the start of the records, we say that any pair of users $X$ and $Y$ are friends if $X$ calls $Y$ or vice-versa. Similarly, $X$ is a friend of a friend of $Z$ if $X$ is a friend of $Y$ and $Y$ is a friend of $Z$; and so on for longer chains.
The Prime Minister's phone number is $524287$. After how many successful calls, not counting misdials, will $99\%$ of the users (including the PM) be a friend, or a friend of a friend etc., of the Prime Minister?

Title: Hyperexponentiation

Question: The hyperexponentiation or tetration of a number $a$ by a positive integer $b$, denoted by $a\mathbin{\uparrow \uparrow}b$ or $^b a$, is recursively defined by:
$a \mathbin{\uparrow \uparrow} 1 = a$,
$a \mathbin{\uparrow \uparrow} (k+1) = a^{(a \mathbin{\uparrow \uparrow} k)}$.

Thus we have e.g. $3 \mathbin{\uparrow \uparrow} 2 = 3^3 = 27$, hence $3 \mathbin{\uparrow \uparrow} 3 = 3^{27} = 7625597484987$ and $3 \mathbin{\uparrow \uparrow} 4$ is roughly $10^{3.6383346400240996 \cdot 10^{12}}$.

Title: Ambiguous Numbers
Problem 198
Question: A best approximation to a real number $x$ for the denominator bound $d$ is a rational number $\frac r s$ (in reduced form) with $s \le d$, so that any rational number $\frac p q$ which is closer to $x$ than $\frac r s$ has $q \gt d$.
Usually the best approximation to a real number is uniquely determined for all denominator bounds. However, there are some exceptions, e.g. $\frac 9 {40}$ has the two best approximations $\frac 1 4$ and $\frac 1 5$ for the denominator bound $6$.
We shall call a real number $x$ ambiguous, if there is at least one denominator bound for which $x$ possesses two best approximations. Clearly, an ambiguous number is necessarily rational.
How many ambiguous numbers $x=\frac p q, 0 \lt x \lt \frac 1 {100}$, are there whose denominator $q$ does not exceed $10^8$?

Title: Iterative Circle Packing
Problem 199
Question: Three circles of equal radius are placed inside a larger circle such that each pair of circles is tangent to one another and the inner circles do not overlap. There are four uncovered "gaps" which are to be filled iteratively with more tangent circles.

At each iteration, a maximally sized circle is placed in each gap, which creates more gaps for the next iteration. After $3$ iterations (pictured), there are $108$ gaps and the fraction of the area which is not covered by circles is $0.06790342$, rounded to eight decimal places.


What fraction of the area is not covered by circles after $10$ iterations?

Title: Prime-proof Squbes
Problem 200

For example, $200 = 5^2 2^3$ or $120072949 = 23^2 61^3$.
The first five squbes are $72, 108, 200, 392$, and $500$.
Interestingly, $200$ is also the first number for which you cannot change any single digit to make a prime; we shall call such numbers, prime-proof. The next prime-proof sqube which contains the contiguous sub-string "$200$" is $1992008$.
Find the $200$th prime-proof sqube containing the contiguous sub-string "$200$".

Title: Subsets with a Unique Sum
Problem 201
Question: For any set $A$ of numbers, let $\operatorname{sum}(A)$ be the sum of the elements of $A$.
Consider the set $B = \{1,3,6,8,10,11\}$. There are $20$ subsets of $B$ containing three elements, and their sums are:
Some of these sums occur more than once, others are unique.
For a set $A$, let $U(A,k)$ be the set of unique sums of $k$-element subsets of $A$, in our example we find $U(B,3) = \{10,12,14,18,21,25,27,29\}$ and $\operatorname{sum}(U(B,3)) = 156$.
Now consider the $100$-element set $S = \{1^2, 2^2, \dots, 100^2\}$.
S has $100891344545564193334812497256$ $50$-element subsets.
Determine the sum of all integers which are the sum of exactly one of the $50$-element subsets of $S$, i.e. find $\operatorname{sum}(U(S,50))$.

where $4^t$, $2^t$, and $k$ are all positive integers and $t$ is a real number.
The first two such partitions are $4^1 = 2^1 + 2$ and $4^{1.5849625\cdots} = 2^{1.5849625\cdots} + 6$.

Title: Balanced Numbers
Problem 217
Question:

So, for example, all palindromes are balanced, as is $13722$.
Let $T(n)$ be the sum of all balanced numbers less than $10^n$. 
Thus: $T(1) = 45$, $T(2) = 540$ and $T(5) = 334795890$.

Title: Skew-cost Coding
Problem 219
Question: Let A and B be bit strings (sequences of 0's and 1's).
If A is equal to the leftmost length(A) bits of B, then A is said to be a prefix of B.
For example, 00110 is a prefix of 001101001, but not of 00111 or 100110.
A prefix-free code of size n is a collection of n distinct bit strings such that no string is a prefix of any other.  For example, this is a prefix-free code of size 6:
0000, 0001, 001, 01, 10, 11
Now suppose that it costs one penny to transmit a '0' bit, but four pence to transmit a '1'.
Then the total cost of the prefix-free code shown above is 35 pence, which happens to be the cheapest possible for the skewed pricing scheme in question.
In short, we write Cost(6) = 35.
What is Cost(109) ?

The initial position of the computer cursor is (0,0), pointing up towards (0,1).
Then Dn is an exotic drawing known as the Heighway Dragon of order n.  For example, D10 is shown below; counting each "F" as one step, the highlighted spot at (18,16) is the position reached after 500 steps.

Title: Prime Factorisation of Binomial Coefficients
Problem 231
Question: The binomial coefficient $\displaystyle \binom {10} 3 = 120$.
$120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5$, and $2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 14$.
So the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of $\displaystyle \binom {10} 3$ is $14$.

Title: Semidivisible Numbers
Problem 234
Question: For an integer $n \ge 4$, we define the lower prime square root of $n$, denoted by $\operatorname{lps}(n)$, as the largest prime $\le \sqrt n$ and the upper prime square root of $n$, $\operatorname{ups}(n)$, as the smallest prime $\ge \sqrt n$.
So, for example, $\operatorname{lps}(4) = 2 = \operatorname{ups}(4)$, $\operatorname{lps}(1000) = 31$, $\operatorname{ups}(1000) = 37$.
Let us call an integer $n \ge 4$ semidivisible, if one of $\operatorname{lps}(n)$ and $\operatorname{ups}(n)$ divides $n$, but not both.
The sum of the semidivisible numbers not exceeding $15$ is $30$, the numbers are $8$, $10$ and $12$. $15$ is not semidivisible because it is a multiple of both $\operatorname{lps}(15) = 3$ and $\operatorname{ups}(15) = 5$.
As a further example, the sum of the $92$ semidivisible numbers up to $1000$ is $34825$.
What is the sum of all semidivisible numbers not exceeding $999966663333$?

Problem 236
Question: Suppliers 'A' and 'B' provided the following numbers of products for the luxury hamper market:

Although the suppliers try very hard to ship their goods in perfect condition, there is inevitably some spoilage - i.e. products gone bad.
The suppliers compare their performance using two types of statistic:
To their surprise, the suppliers found that each of the five per-product spoilage rates was worse (higher) for 'B' than for 'A' by the same factor (ratio of spoilage rates), m>1; and yet, paradoxically, the overall spoilage rate was worse for 'A' than for 'B', also by a factor of m.
There are thirty-five m>1 for which this surprising result could have occurred, the smallest of which is 1476/1475.
What's the largest possible value of m?

Title: Infinite String Tour
Problem 238
Question: Create a sequence of numbers using the "Blum Blum Shub" pseudo-random number generator:
Concatenate these numbers $s_0s_1s_2\cdots$ to create a string $w$ of infinite length.
Then, $w = {\color{blue}14025256741014958470038053646\cdots}$
For a positive integer $k$, if no substring of $w$ exists with a sum of digits equal to $k$, $p(k)$ is defined to be zero. If at least one substring of $w$ exists with a sum of digits equal to $k$, we define $p(k) = z$, where $z$ is the starting position of the earliest such substring.
For instance:
The substrings $\color{blue}1, 14, 1402, \dots$
with respective sums of digits equal to $1, 5, 7, \dots$
start at position $\mathbf 1$, hence $p(1) = p(5) = p(7) = \cdots = \mathbf 1$.
The substrings $\color{blue}4, 402, 4025, \dots$
with respective sums of digits equal to $4, 6, 11, \dots$
start at position $\mathbf 2$, hence $p(4) = p(6) = p(11) = \cdots = \mathbf 2$.
The substrings $\color{blue}02, 0252, \dots$
with respective sums of digits equal to $2, 9, \dots$
start at position $\mathbf 3$, hence $p(2) = p(9) = \cdots = \mathbf 3$.
Note that substring $\color{blue}025$ starting at position $\mathbf 3$, has a sum of digits equal to $7$, but there was an earlier substring (starting at position $\mathbf 1$) with a sum of digits equal to $7$, so $p(7) = 1$, not $3$.
We can verify that, for $0 \lt k \le 10^3$, $\sum p(k) = 4742$.
Find $\sum p(k)$, for $0 \lt k \le 2 \times 10^{15}$.

For example, $f(5,3) = 4$, since the set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ has four $3$-element subsets having an odd sum of elements, i.e.: $\{1,2,4\}$, $\{1,3,5\}$, $\{2,3,4\}$ and $\{2,4,5\}$.
When all three values $n$, $k$ and $f(n, k)$ are odd, we say that they make
an odd-triplet $[n,k,f(n, k)]$.
There are exactly five odd-triplets with $n \le 10$, namely:
$[1,1,f(1,1) = 1]$, $[5,1,f(5,1) = 3]$, $[5,5,f(5,5) = 1]$, $[9,1,f(9,1) = 5]$ and $[9,9,f(9,9) = 1]$.

Question: A positive fraction whose numerator is less than its denominator is called a proper fraction.
For any denominator, $d$, there will be $d - 1$ proper fractions; for example, with $d = 12$:$1 / 12, 2 / 12, 3 / 12, 4 / 12, 5 / 12, 6 / 12, 7 / 12, 8 / 12, 9 / 12, 10 / 12, 11 / 12$.

We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient fraction.
Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, $R(d)$, to be the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, $R(12) = 4/11$.
In fact, $d = 12$ is the smallest denominator having a resilience $R(d) \lt 4/10$.
Find the smallest denominator $d$, having a resilience $R(d) \lt 15499/94744$.

Title: Tidying Up A
Problem 253
Question: A small child has a “number caterpillar” consisting of forty jigsaw pieces, each with one number on it, which, when connected together in a line, reveal the numbers $1$ to $40$ in order.
Every night, the child's father has to pick up the pieces of the caterpillar that have been scattered across the play room. He picks up the pieces at random and places them in the correct order. As the caterpillar is built up in this way, it forms distinct segments that gradually merge together. The number of segments starts at zero (no pieces placed), generally increases up to about eleven or twelve, then tends to drop again before finishing at a single segment (all pieces placed).


For example:
Let $M$ be the maximum number of segments encountered during a random tidy-up of the caterpillar.
For a caterpillar of ten pieces, the number of possibilities for each $M$ is
so the most likely value of $M$ is $3$ and the average value is $385643/113400 = 3.400732$, rounded to six decimal places.
The most likely value of $M$ for a forty-piece caterpillar is $11$; but what is the average value of $M$?

Define $sf(n)$ as the sum of the digits of $f(n)$. So $sf(342) = 3 + 2 = 5$.

Title: Rounded Square Roots
Problem 255
Question: We define the rounded-square-root of a positive integer $n$ as the square root of $n$ rounded to the nearest integer.
The following procedure (essentially Heron's method adapted to integer arithmetic) finds the rounded-square-root of $n$:
Let $d$ be the number of digits of the number $n$.
If $d$ is odd, set $x_0 = 2 \times 10^{(d-1)/2}$.
If $d$ is even, set $x_0 = 7 \times 10^{(d-2)/2}$.
Repeat:
until $x_{k+1} = x_k$.
As an example, let us find the rounded-square-root of $n = 4321$.$n$ has $4$ digits, so $x_0 = 7 \times 10^{(4-2)/2} = 70$.
$$x_1 = \Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{70 + \lceil{4321 / 70}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor = 66$$
$$x_2 = \Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{66 + \lceil{4321 / 66}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor = 66$$

Since $x_2 = x_1$, we stop here.
So, after just two iterations, we have found that the rounded-square-root of $4321$ is $66$ (the actual square root is $65.7343137\cdots$).

The number of iterations required when using this method is surprisingly low.
For example, we can find the rounded-square-root of a $5$-digit integer ($10\,000 \le n \le 99\,999$) with an average of $3.2102888889$ iterations (the average value was rounded to $10$ decimal places).

Using the procedure described above, what is the average number of iterations required to find the rounded-square-root of a $14$-digit number ($10^{13} \le n \lt 10^{14}$)?
Give your answer rounded to $10$ decimal places.

Note: The symbols $\lfloor x \rfloor$ and $\lceil x \rceil$ represent the floor functionthe largest integer not greater than $x$ and ceiling functionthe smallest integer not less than $x$ respectively.

Title: Tatami-Free Rooms
Problem 256
Question: Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room, without overlap.
Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions $1 \times 2$, there are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the rooms that can be covered.
For this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer dimensions $a, b$ and even size $s = a \cdot b$.
We use the term 'size' to denote the floor surface area of the room, and — without loss of generality — we add the condition $a \le b$.
There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no points where corners of four different mats meet.
For example, consider the two arrangements below for a $4 \times 4$ room:
The arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right is not: a red "X" in the middle, marks the point where four tatami meet.
Because of this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with tatami: we call them tatami-free rooms.
Further, we define $T(s)$ as the number of tatami-free rooms of size $s$.
The smallest tatami-free room has size $s = 70$ and dimensions $7 \times 10$.
All the other rooms of size $s = 70$ can be covered with tatami; they are: $1 \times 70$, $2 \times 35$ and $5 \times 14$.
Hence, $T(70) = 1$.
Similarly, we can verify that $T(1320) = 5$ because there are exactly $5$ tatami-free rooms of size $s = 1320$:
$20 \times 66$, $22 \times 60$, $24 \times 55$, $30 \times 44$ and $33 \times 40$.
In fact, $s = 1320$ is the smallest room-size $s$ for which $T(s) = 5$.
Find the smallest room-size $s$ for which $T(s) = 200$.

The angular bisectors of the triangle intersect the sides at points $E$, $F$ and $G$ (see picture below).


The segments $EF$, $EG$ and $FG$ partition the triangle $ABC$ into four smaller triangles: $AEG$, $BFE$, $CGF$ and $EFG$.
It can be proven that for each of these four triangles the ratio area($ABC$)/area(subtriangle) is rational.
However, there exist triangles for which some or all of these ratios are integral.


How many triangles $ABC$ with perimeter $\le 100\,000\,000$ exist so that the ratio area($ABC$)/area($AEG$) is integral?

Title: Stone Game
Problem 260
Question: A game is played with three piles of stones and two players.
On each player's turn, the player may remove one or more stones from the piles. However, if the player takes stones from more than one pile, then the same number of stones must be removed from each of the selected piles.
In other words, the player chooses some $N \gt 0$ and removes:
The player taking the last stone(s) wins the game.
A winning configuration is one where the first player can force a win.
For example, $(0,0,13)$, $(0,11,11)$, and $(5,5,5)$ are winning configurations because the first player can immediately remove all stones.
A losing configuration is one where the second player can force a win, no matter what the first player does.
For example, $(0,1,2)$ and $(1,3,3)$ are losing configurations: any legal move leaves a winning configuration for the second player.
Consider all losing configurations $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ where $x_i \le y_i \le z_i \le 100$.
We can verify that $\sum (x_i + y_i + z_i) = 173895$ for these.
Find $\sum (x_i + y_i + z_i)$ where $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ ranges over the losing configurations with $x_i \le y_i \le z_i \le 1000$.

Title: Mountain Range
Problem 262
Question: The following equation represents the continuous topography of a mountainous region, giving the elevationheight above sea level $h$ at any point $(x, y)$:
$$h = \left(5000 - \frac{x^2 + y^2 + xy}{200} + \frac{25(x + y)}2\right) \cdot e^{-\left|\frac{x^2 + y^2}{1000000} - \frac{3(x + y)}{2000} + \frac 7 {10}\right|}.$$

A mosquito intends to fly from $A(200,200)$ to $B(1400,1400)$, without leaving the area given by $0 \le x, y \le 1600$.
Because of the intervening mountains, it first rises straight up to a point $A^\prime$, having elevation $f$. Then, while remaining at the same elevation $f$, it flies around any obstacles until it arrives at a point $B^\prime$ directly above $B$.
First, determine $f_{\mathrm{min}}$ which is the minimum constant elevation allowing such a trip from $A$ to $B$, while remaining in the specified area.
Then, find the length of the shortest path between $A^\prime$ and $B^\prime$, while flying at that constant elevation $f_{\mathrm{min}}$.
Give that length as your answer, rounded to three decimal places.
Note: For convenience, the elevation function shown above is repeated below, in a form suitable for most programming languages:
h=( 5000-0.005*(x*x+y*y+x*y)+12.5*(x+y) ) * exp( -abs(0.000001*(x*x+y*y)-0.0015*(x+y)+0.7) )

Consider the number $6$. The divisors of $6$ are: $1,2,3$ and $6$.

A number $n$ is called a practical number if every number from $1$ up to and including $n$ can be expressed as a sum of distinct divisors of $n$.

Title: Binary Circles
Problem 265
Question: $2^N$ binary digits can be placed in a circle so that all the $N$-digit clockwise subsequences are distinct.
For $N=3$, two such circular arrangements are possible, ignoring rotations:
For the first arrangement, the $3$-digit subsequences, in clockwise order, are:$000$, $001$, $010$, $101$, $011$, $111$, $110$ and $100$.
Each circular arrangement can be encoded as a number by concatenating the binary digits starting with the subsequence of all zeros as the most significant bits and proceeding clockwise. The two arrangements for $N=3$ are thus represented as $23$ and $29$:

Calling $S(N)$ the sum of the unique numeric representations, we can see that $S(3) = 23 + 29 = 52$.
Find $S(5)$.

Title: Divisibility Multipliers
Problem 274
Question: For each integer $p \gt 1$ coprime to $10$ there is a positive divisibility multiplier $m \lt p$ which preserves divisibility by $p$ for the following function on any positive integer, $n$:
$f(n) = (\text{all but the last digit of }n) + (\text{the last digit of }n) \cdot m$.
That is, if $m$ is the divisibility multiplier for $p$, then $f(n)$ is divisible by $p$ if and only if $n$ is divisible by $p$.
(When $n$ is much larger than $p$, $f(n)$ will be less than $n$ and repeated application of $f$ provides a multiplicative divisibility test for $p$.)
For example, the divisibility multiplier for $113$ is $34$.
$f(76275) = 7627 + 5 \cdot 34 = 7797$: $76275$ and $7797$ are both divisible by $113$.$f(12345) = 1234 + 5 \cdot 34 = 1404$: $12345$ and $1404$ are both not divisible by $113$.
The sum of the divisibility multipliers for the primes that are coprime to $10$ and less than $1000$ is $39517$. What is the sum of the divisibility multipliers for the primes that are coprime to $10$ and less than $10^7$?

Title: A Modified Collatz Sequence
Problem 277
Question: 
A modified Collatz sequence of integers is obtained from a starting value $a_1$ in the following way:

$a_{n+1} = \, \,\, \frac {a_n} 3 \quad$ if $a_n$ is divisible by $3$. We shall denote this as a large downward step, "D".

$a_{n+1} = \frac {4 a_n+2} 3 \, \,$ if $a_n$ divided by $3$ gives a remainder of $1$. We shall denote this as an upward step, "U".


$a_{n+1} = \frac {2 a_n -1} 3 \, \,$ if $a_n$ divided by $3$ gives a remainder of $2$. We shall denote this as a small downward step, "d".


The sequence terminates when some $a_n = 1$.


Given any integer, we can list out the sequence of steps.
For instance if $a_1=231$, then the sequence $\{a_n\}=\{231,77,51,17,11,7,10,14,9,3,1\}$ corresponds to the steps "DdDddUUdDD".


Of course, there are other sequences that begin with that same sequence "DdDddUUdDD....".
For instance, if $a_1=1004064$, then the sequence is DdDddUUdDDDdUDUUUdDdUUDDDUdDD.
In fact, $1004064$ is the smallest possible $a_1 > 10^6$ that begins with the sequence DdDddUUdDD.


What is the smallest $a_1 > 10^{15}$ that begins with the sequence "UDDDUdddDDUDDddDdDddDDUDDdUUDd"?

Title: Linear Combinations of Semiprimes
Problem 278
Question: 
Given the values of integers $1 < a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n$, consider the linear combination
$q_1 a_1+q_2 a_2 + \dots + q_n a_n=b$, using only integer values $q_k \ge 0$. 


Note that for a given set of $a_k$, it may be that not all values of $b$ are possible.
For instance, if $a_1=5$ and $a_2=7$, there are no $q_1 \ge 0$ and $q_2 \ge 0$ such that $b$ could be 
$1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18$ or $23$.

In fact, $23$ is the largest impossible value of $b$ for $a_1=5$ and $a_2=7$. We therefore call $f(5, 7) = 23$. Similarly, it can be shown that $f(6, 10, 15)=29$ and $f(14, 22, 77) = 195$.

Question: The 3-digit number 376 in the decimal numbering system is an example of numbers with the special property that its square ends with the same digits: 3762 = 141376. Let's call a number with this property a steady square.
Steady squares can also be observed in other numbering systems.

Title: Pythagorean Odds
Problem 285
Question: Albert chooses a positive integer $k$, then two real numbers $a, b$ are randomly chosen in the interval $[0,1]$ with uniform distribution.
The square root of the sum $(k \cdot a + 1)^2 + (k \cdot b + 1)^2$ is then computed and rounded to the nearest integer. If the result is equal to $k$, he scores $k$ points; otherwise he scores nothing.
For example, if $k = 6$, $a = 0.2$ and $b = 0.85$, then $(k \cdot a + 1)^2 + (k \cdot b + 1)^2 = 42.05$.
The square root of $42.05$ is $6.484\cdots$ and when rounded to the nearest integer, it becomes $6$.
This is equal to $k$, so he scores $6$ points.
It can be shown that if he plays $10$ turns with $k = 1, k = 2, \dots, k = 10$, the expected value of his total score, rounded to five decimal places, is $10.20914$.
If he plays $10^5$ turns with $k = 1, k = 2, k = 3, \dots, k = 10^5$, what is the expected value of his total score, rounded to five decimal places?

Title: An Enormous Factorial
Problem 288
Question: 
For any prime $p$ the number $N(p, q)$ is defined by
$N(p, q) = \sum_{n = 0}^q T_n \cdot p^n$
with $T_n$ generated by the following random number generator:

$S_0 = 290797$

Title: Eulerian Cycles
Problem 289
Question: Let $C(x, y)$ be a circle passing through the points $(x, y)$, $(x, y + 1)$, $(x + 1, y)$ and $(x + 1, y + 1)$.
For positive integers $m$ and $n$, let $E(m, n)$ be a configuration which consists of the $m \cdot n$ circles:
$\{ C(x, y): 0 \le x \lt m, 0 \le y \lt n, x \text{ and } y \text{ are integers} \}$.
An Eulerian cycle on $E(m, n)$ is a closed path that passes through each arc exactly once.
Many such paths are possible on $E(m, n)$, but we are only interested in those which are not self-crossing: a non-crossing path just touches itself at lattice points, but it never crosses itself.
The image below shows $E(3,3)$ and an example of an Eulerian non-crossing path.
Let $L(m, n)$ be the number of Eulerian non-crossing paths on $E(m, n)$.
For example, $L(1,2) = 2$, $L(2,2) = 37$ and $L(3,3) = 104290$.
Find $L(6,10) \bmod 10^{10}$.

Title: Pseudo-Fortunate Numbers
Problem 293
Question: 
An even positive integer $N$ will be called admissible, if it is a power of $2$ or its distinct prime factors are consecutive primes.
The first twelve admissible numbers are $2,4,6,8,12,16,18,24,30,32,36,48$.


If $N$ is admissible, the smallest integer $M \gt 1$ such that $N+M$ is prime, will be called the pseudo-Fortunate number for $N$.


For example, $N=630$ is admissible since it is even and its distinct prime factors are the consecutive primes $2,3,5$ and $7$. 
The next prime number after $631$ is $641$; hence, the pseudo-Fortunate number for $630$ is $M=11$.
It can also be seen that the pseudo-Fortunate number for $16$ is $3$.


Find the sum of all distinct pseudo-Fortunate numbers for admissible numbers $N$ less than $10^9$.

Title: Lenticular Holes
Problem 295
Question: We call the convex area enclosed by two circles a lenticular hole if:

Consider the circles:
$C_0$: $x^2 + y^2 = 25$
$C_1$: $(x + 4)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 1$
$C_2$: $(x - 12)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 65$


The circles $C_0$, $C_1$ and $C_2$ are drawn in the picture below.

$C_0$ and $C_1$ form a lenticular hole, as well as $C_0$ and $C_2$.

We call an ordered pair of positive real numbers $(r_1, r_2)$ a lenticular pair if there exist two circles with radii $r_1$ and $r_2$ that form a lenticular hole.
We can verify that $(1, 5)$ and $(5, \sqrt{65})$ are the lenticular pairs of the example above.

Let $L(N)$ be the number of distinct lenticular pairs $(r_1, r_2)$ for which $0 \lt r_1 \le r_2 \le N$.
We can verify that $L(10) = 30$ and $L(100) = 3442$.

Title: Zeckendorf Representation
Problem 297
Question: Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
Starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be: $1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89$.
Every positive integer can be uniquely written as a sum of nonconsecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence. For example, $100 = 3 + 8 + 89$.
Such a sum is called the Zeckendorf representation of the number.
For any integer $n \gt 0$, let $z(n)$ be the number of terms in the Zeckendorf representation of $n$.
Thus, $z(5) = 1$, $z(14) = 2$, $z(100) = 3$ etc.
Also, for $0 \lt n \lt 10^6$, $\sum z(n) = 7894453$.

Title: Selective Amnesia
Problem 298
Question: Larry and Robin play a memory game involving a sequence of random numbers between 1 and 10, inclusive, that are called out one at a time. Each player can remember up to 5 previous numbers. When the called number is in a player's memory, that player is awarded a point. If it's not, the player adds the called number to his memory, removing another number if his memory is full.
Both players start with empty memories. Both players always add new missed numbers to their memory but use a different strategy in deciding which number to remove:
Larry's strategy is to remove the number that hasn't been called in the longest time.
Robin's strategy is to remove the number that's been in the memory the longest time.
Example game:
Denoting Larry's score by L and Robin's score by R, what is the expected value of |L-R| after 50 turns? Give your answer rounded to eight decimal places using the format x.xxxxxxxx .

Title: Three Similar Triangles
Problem 299
Question: Four points with integer coordinates are selected:$A(a, 0)$, $B(b, 0)$, $C(0, c)$ and $D(0, d)$, with $0 \lt a \lt b$ and $0 \lt c \lt d$.
Point $P$, also with integer coordinates, is chosen on the line $AC$ so that the three triangles $ABP$, $CDP$ and $BDP$ are all similarHave equal angles.
It is easy to prove that the three triangles can be similar, only if $a = c$.
So, given that $a = c$, we are looking for triplets $(a, b, d)$ such that at least one point $P$ (with integer coordinates) exists on $AC$, making the three triangles $ABP$, $CDP$ and $BDP$ all similar.
For example, if $(a, b, d)=(2,3,4)$, it can be easily verified that point $P(1,1)$ satisfies the above condition. 
Note that the triplets $(2,3,4)$ and $(2,4,3)$ are considered as distinct, although point $P(1,1)$ is common for both.
If $b + d \lt 100$, there are $92$ distinct triplets $(a, b, d)$ such that point $P$ exists.
If $b + d \lt 100\,000$, there are $320471$ distinct triplets $(a, b, d)$ such that point $P$ exists.
If $b + d \lt 100\,000\,000$, how many distinct triplets $(a, b, d)$ are there such that point $P$ exists?

Title: Protein Folding
Problem 300
Question: In a very simplified form, we can consider proteins as strings consisting of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) elements, e.g. HHPPHHHPHHPH. 
For this problem, the orientation of a protein is important; e.g. HPP is considered distinct from PPH. Thus, there are $2^n$ distinct proteins consisting of $n$ elements.
When one encounters these strings in nature, they are always folded in such a way that the number of H-H contact points is as large as possible, since this is energetically advantageous.
As a result, the H-elements tend to accumulate in the inner part, with the P-elements on the outside.
Natural proteins are folded in three dimensions of course, but we will only consider protein folding in two dimensions.
The figure below shows two possible ways that our example protein could be folded (H-H contact points are shown with red dots).
The folding on the left has only six H-H contact points, thus it would never occur naturally.
On the other hand, the folding on the right has nine H-H contact points, which is optimal for this string.
Assuming that H and P elements are equally likely to occur in any position along the string, the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of a random protein string of length $8$ turns out to be $850 / 2^8 = 3.3203125$.
What is the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of a random protein string of length $15$?
Give your answer using as many decimal places as necessary for an exact result.

Title: Nim
Problem 301
Question: Nim is a game played with heaps of stones, where two players take it in turn to remove any number of stones from any heap until no stones remain.
We'll consider the three-heap normal-play version of Nim, which works as follows:
If $(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ indicates a Nim position consisting of heaps of size $n_1$, $n_2$, and $n_3$, then there is a simple function, which you may look up or attempt to deduce for yourself, $X(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ that returns:
For example $X(1,2,3) = 0$ because, no matter what the current player does, the opponent can respond with a move that leaves two heaps of equal size, at which point every move by the current player can be mirrored by the opponent until no stones remain; so the current player loses. To illustrate:
For how many positive integers $n \le 2^{30}$ does $X(n,2n,3n) = 0$ ?

Title: Strong Achilles Numbers
Problem 302
Question: 
A positive integer $n$ is powerful if $p^2$ is a divisor of $n$ for every prime factor $p$ in $n$.


A positive integer $n$ is a perfect power if $n$ can be expressed as a power of another positive integer.


A positive integer $n$ is an Achilles number if $n$ is powerful but not a perfect power. For example, $864$ and $1800$ are Achilles numbers: $864 = 2^5 \cdot 3^3$ and $1800 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2$.


We shall call a positive integer $S$ a Strong Achilles number if both $S$ and $\phi(S)$ are Achilles numbers.1
For example, $864$ is a Strong Achilles number: $\phi(864) = 288 = 2^5 \cdot 3^2$. However, $1800$ isn't a Strong Achilles number because: $\phi(1800) = 480 = 2^5 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1$.

There are $7$ Strong Achilles numbers below $10^4$ and $656$ below $10^8$.


How many Strong Achilles numbers are there below $10^{18}$?

Title: An Amazing Prime-generating Automaton
Problem 308
Question: A program written in the programming language Fractran consists of a list of fractions.
The internal state of the Fractran Virtual Machine is a positive integer, which is initially set to a seed value. Each iteration of a Fractran program multiplies the state integer by the first fraction in the list which will leave it an integer.
For example, one of the Fractran programs that John Horton Conway wrote for prime-generation consists of the following 14 fractions:
$$\dfrac{17}{91}, \dfrac{78}{85}, \dfrac{19}{51}, \dfrac{23}{38}, \dfrac{29}{33}, \dfrac{77}{29}, \dfrac{95}{23}, \dfrac{77}{19}, \dfrac{1}{17}, \dfrac{11}{13}, \dfrac{13}{11}, \dfrac{15}{2}, \dfrac{1}{7}, \dfrac{55}{1}$$
Starting with the seed integer 2, successive iterations of the program produce the sequence:
15, 825, 725, 1925, 2275, 425, ..., 68, 4, 30, ..., 136, 8, 60, ..., 544, 32, 240, ...
The powers of 2 that appear in this sequence are 22, 23, 25, ...
It can be shown that all the powers of 2 in this sequence have prime exponents and that all the primes appear as exponents of powers of 2, in proper order!
If someone uses the above Fractran program to solve Project Euler Problem 7 (find the 10001st prime), how many iterations would be needed until the program produces 210001st prime ?

Title: Integer Ladders
Problem 309
Question: In the classic "Crossing Ladders" problem, we are given the lengths $x$ and $y$ of two ladders resting on the opposite walls of a narrow, level street. We are also given the height $h$ above the street where the two ladders cross and we are asked to find the width of the street ($w$).
Here, we are only concerned with instances where all four variables are positive integers.
For example, if $x = 70$, $y = 119$ and $h = 30$, we can calculate that $w = 56$.
In fact, for integer values $x$, $y$, $h$ and $0 \lt x \lt y \lt 200$, there are only five triplets $(x, y, h)$ producing integer solutions for $w$:
$(70, 119, 30)$, $(74, 182, 21)$, $(87, 105, 35)$, $(100, 116, 35)$ and $(119, 175, 40)$.
For integer values $x, y, h$ and $0 \lt x \lt y \lt 1\,000\,000$, how many triplets $(x, y, h)$ produce integer solutions for $w$?

Title: The Mouse on the Moon
Problem 314
Question: 
The moon has been opened up, and land can be obtained for free, but there is a catch. You have to build a wall around the land that you stake out, and building a wall on the moon is expensive. Every country has been allotted a $\pu{500 m}$ by $\pu{500 m}$ square area, but they will possess only that area which they wall in. $251001$ posts have been placed in a rectangular grid with $1$ meter spacing. The wall must be a closed series of straight lines, each line running from post to post.


The bigger countries of course have built a $\pu{2000 m}$ wall enclosing the entire $\pu{250 000 m^2}$ area. The Duchy of Grand Fenwick, has a tighter budget, and has asked you (their Royal Programmer) to compute what shape would get best maximum enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.


You have done some preliminary calculations on a sheet of paper.
For a $2000$ meter wall enclosing the $\pu{250 000 m^2}$ area the
enclosed-area/wall-length ratio is $125$.
Although not allowed , but to get an idea if this is anything better:  if you place a circle inside the square area touching the four sides the area will be equal to $\pi \times \pu{250^2 m^2}$ and the perimeter will be $\pi \times \pu{500 m}$, so the enclosed-area/wall-length ratio will also be $125$.


However, if you cut off from the square four triangles with sides $\pu{75 m}$, $\pu{75 m}$ and $75\pu{\sqrt 2 m}$ the total area becomes $\pu{238750 m^2}$ and the perimeter becomes $1400+300\pu{\sqrt 2 m}$. So this gives an enclosed-area/wall-length ratio of $130.87$, which is significantly better.


Find the maximum enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.
Give your answer rounded to $8$ places behind the decimal point in the form abc.defghijk.

Title: Digital Root Clocks
Problem 315
Question: 
Sam and Max are asked to transform two digital clocks into two "digital root" clocks.
A digital root clock is a digital clock that calculates digital roots step by step.
When a clock is fed a number, it will show it and then it will start the calculation, showing all the intermediate values until it gets to the result.
For example, if the clock is fed the number 137, it will show: "137" → "11" → "2" and then it will go black, waiting for the next number.
Every digital number consists of some light segments: three horizontal (top, middle, bottom) and four vertical (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
Number "1" is made of vertical top-right and bottom-right, number "4" is made by middle horizontal and vertical top-left, top-right and bottom-right. Number "8" lights them all.
The clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off.
To turn on a "2" will cost 5 transitions, while a "7" will cost only 4 transitions.
Sam and Max built two different clocks.
Sam's clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows "137", then the panel is turned off, then the next number ("11") is turned on, then the panel is turned off again and finally the last number ("2") is turned on and, after some time, off.
For the example, with number 137, Sam's clock requires:
Max's clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel, it is smart enough to turn off only those segments that won't be needed for the next number.
For number 137, Max's clock requires:
Of course, Max's clock consumes less power than Sam's one.
The two clocks are fed all the prime numbers between A = 107 and B = 2×107. 
Find the difference between the total number of transitions needed by Sam's clock and that needed by Max's one.

Title: Numbers in Decimal Expansions
Problem 316
Question: Let $p = p_1 p_2 p_3 \cdots$ be an infinite sequence of random digits, selected from $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ with equal probability.
It can be seen that $p$ corresponds to the real number $0.p_1 p_2 p_3 \cdots$ 
It can also be seen that choosing a random real number from the interval $[0,1)$ is equivalent to choosing an infinite sequence of random digits selected from $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ with equal probability.
For any positive integer $n$ with $d$ decimal digits, let $k$ be the smallest index such that $p_k, p_{k + 1}, \dots, p_{k + d - 1}$ are the decimal digits of $n$, in the same order.
Also, let $g(n)$ be the expected value of $k$; it can be proven that $g(n)$ is always finite and, interestingly, always an integer number.
For example, if $n = 535$, then
for $p = 31415926\mathbf{535}897\cdots$, we get $k = 9$
for $p = 35528714365004956000049084876408468\mathbf{535}4\cdots$, we get $k = 36$
etc and we find that $g(535) = 1008$.
Given that $\displaystyle\sum_{n = 2}^{999} g \left(\left\lfloor\frac{10^6} n \right\rfloor\right) = 27280188$, find $\displaystyle\sum_{n = 2}^{999999} g \left(\left\lfloor\frac{10^{16}} n \right\rfloor\right)$.

Title: 2011 Nines
Problem 318
Question: 
Consider the real number $\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3$.
When we calculate the even powers of $\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3$
we get:
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^2 = 9.898979485566356 \cdots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^4 = 97.98979485566356 \cdots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^6 = 969.998969071069263 \cdots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^8 = 9601.99989585502907 \cdots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^{10} = 95049.999989479221 \cdots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^{12} = 940897.9999989371855 \cdots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^{14} = 9313929.99999989263 \cdots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^{16} = 92198401.99999998915 \cdots $

It looks as if the number of consecutive nines at the beginning of the fractional part of these powers is non-decreasing.
In fact it can be proven that the fractional part of $(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^{2 n}$ approaches $1$ for large $n$.


Consider all real numbers of the form $\sqrt p + \sqrt q$ with $p$ and $q$ positive integers and $p < q$, such that the fractional part 
of $(\sqrt p + \sqrt q)^{ 2 n}$ approaches $1$ for large $n$.


Let $C(p,q,n)$ be the number of consecutive nines at the beginning of the fractional part of $(\sqrt p + \sqrt q)^{ 2 n}$.


Let $N(p,q)$ be the minimal value of $n$ such that $C(p,q,n) \ge 2011$.


Find $\displaystyle \sum N(p,q) \,\, \text{ for } p+q \le 2011$.

Title: Swapping Counters
Problem 321
Question: A horizontal row comprising of $2n + 1$ squares has $n$ red counters placed at one end and $n$ blue counters at the other end, being separated by a single empty square in the centre. For example, when $n = 3$.

A counter can move from one square to the next (slide) or can jump over another counter (hop) as long as the square next to that counter is unoccupied.

Let $M(n)$ represent the minimum number of moves/actions to completely reverse the positions of the coloured counters; that is, move all the red counters to the right and all the blue counters to the left.
It can be verified $M(3) = 15$, which also happens to be a triangle number.
If we create a sequence based on the values of $n$ for which $M(n)$ is a triangle number then the first five terms would be:
$1$, $3$, $10$, $22$, and $63$, and their sum would be $99$.
Find the sum of the first forty terms of this sequence.

Title: Stone Game II
Problem 325
Question: A game is played with two piles of stones and two players.
On each player's turn, the player may remove a number of stones from the larger pile.
The number of stones removed must be a positive multiple of the number of stones in the smaller pile.
E.g. Let the ordered pair $(6,14)$ describe a configuration with $6$ stones in the smaller pile and $14$ stones in the larger pile, then the first player can remove $6$ or $12$ stones from the larger pile.
The player taking all the stones from a pile wins the game.
A winning configuration is one where the first player can force a win. For example, $(1,5)$, $(2,6)$, and $(3,12)$ are winning configurations because the first player can immediately remove all stones in the second pile.
A losing configuration is one where the second player can force a win, no matter what the first player does. For example, $(2,3)$ and $(3,4)$ are losing configurations: any legal move leaves a winning configuration for the second player.
Define $S(N)$ as the sum of $(x_i + y_i)$ for all losing configurations $(x_i, y_i), 0 \lt x_i \lt y_i \le N$.
We can verify that $S(10) = 211$ and $S(10^4) = 230312207313$.
Find $S(10^{16}) \bmod 7^{10}$.

So the first $10$ elements of $a_n$ are: $1,1,0,3,0,3,5,4,1,9$.

Let $f(N, M)$ represent the number of pairs $(p, q)$ such that:

Title: Rooms of Doom
Problem 327
Question: A series of three rooms are connected to each other by automatic doors.
Each door is operated by a security card. Once you enter a room the door automatically closes and that security card cannot be used again. A machine at the start will dispense an unlimited number of cards, but each room (including the starting room) contains scanners and if they detect that you are holding more than three security cards or if they detect an unattended security card on the floor, then all the doors will become permanently locked. However, each room contains a box where you may safely store any number of security cards for use at a later stage.
If you simply tried to travel through the rooms one at a time then as you entered room 3 you would have used all three cards and would be trapped in that room forever!
However, if you make use of the storage boxes, then escape is possible. For example, you could enter room 1 using your first card, place one card in the storage box, and use your third card to exit the room back to the start. Then after collecting three more cards from the dispensing machine you could use one to enter room 1 and collect the card you placed in the box a moment ago. You now have three cards again and will be able to travel through the remaining three doors. This method allows you to travel through all three rooms using six security cards in total.
It is possible to travel through six rooms using a total of $123$ security cards while carrying a maximum of $3$ cards.
Let $C$ be the maximum number of cards which can be carried at any time.
Let $R$ be the number of rooms to travel through.
Let $M(C,R)$ be the minimum number of cards required from the dispensing machine to travel through $R$ rooms carrying up to a maximum of $C$ cards at any time.
For example, $M(3,6)=123$ and $M(4,6)=23$.And, $\sum M(C, 6) = 146$ for $3 \le C \le 4$.
You are given that $\sum M(C,10)=10382$ for $3 \le C \le 10$.
Find $\sum M(C,30)$ for $3 \le C \le 40$.

Title: Lowest-cost Search
Problem 328
Question: We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ by asking questions. 
Each number (question) we ask, has a cost equal to the number asked and we get one of three possible answers:
Given the value of $n$, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost (i.e. the sum of all the questions asked) for the worst possible case. E.g.
If $n=3$, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number "2". The answer will immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a total cost $= 2$).
If $n=8$, we might decide to use a "binary search" type of strategy: Our first question would be "$\mathbf 4$" and if the hidden number is higher than $4$ we will need one or two additional questions.
Let our second question be "$\mathbf 6$". If the hidden number is still higher than $6$, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between $7$ and $8$.
Thus, our third question will be "$\mathbf 7$" and the total cost for this worst-case scenario will be $4+6+7={\color{red}\mathbf{17}}$.
We can improve considerably the worst-case cost for $n=8$, by asking "$\mathbf 5$" as our first question.
If we are told that the hidden number is higher than $5$, our second question will be "$\mathbf 7$", then we'll know for certain what the hidden number is (for a total cost of $5+7={\color{blue}\mathbf{12}}$).
If we are told that the hidden number is lower than $5$, our second question will be "$\mathbf 3$" and if the hidden number is lower than $3$ our third question will be "$\mathbf 1$", giving a total cost of $5+3+1={\color{blue}\mathbf 9}$.
Since ${\color{blue}\mathbf{12}} \gt {\color{blue}\mathbf 9}$, the worst-case cost for this strategy is ${\color{red}\mathbf{12}}$. That's better than what we achieved previously with the "binary search" strategy; it is also better than or equal to any other strategy.
So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for $n=8$.
Let $C(n)$ be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for $n$, as described above.
Thus $C(1) = 0$, $C(2) = 1$, $C(3) = 2$ and $C(8) = 12$.
Similarly, $C(100) = 400$ and $\sum \limits_{n = 1}^{100} C(n) = 17575$.
Find $\sum \limits_{n = 1}^{200000} C(n)$.

Title: Prime Frog
Problem 329
Question: Susan has a prime frog.
Her frog is jumping around over $500$ squares numbered $1$ to $500$.
He can only jump one square to the left or to the right, with equal probability, and he cannot jump outside the range $[1;500]$.(if it lands at either end, it automatically jumps to the only available square on the next move.)


When he is on a square with a prime number on it, he croaks 'P' (PRIME) with probability $2/3$ or 'N' (NOT PRIME) with probability $1/3$ just before jumping to the next square.
When he is on a square with a number on it that is not a prime he croaks 'P' with probability $1/3$ or 'N' with probability $2/3$ just before jumping to the next square.


Given that the frog's starting position is random with the same probability for every square, and given that she listens to his first $15$ croaks, what is the probability that she hears the sequence PPPPNNPPPNPPNPN?

Question: For example,

$a(1) = \dfrac{e - 1}{1!} + \dfrac{1}{2!} + \dfrac{1}{3!} + \cdots = 2e - 3$

At each turn, you may choose a disk and flip all the disks in the same row and the same column as this disk: thus $2 \times N - 1$ disks are flipped. The game ends when all disks show their white side. The following example shows a game on a $5 \times 5$ board.
It can be proven that $3$ is the minimal number of turns to finish this game.
The bottom left disk on the $N \times N$ board has coordinates $(0,0)$;
the bottom right disk has coordinates $(N-1,0)$ and the top left disk has coordinates $(0,N-1)$. 
Let $C_N$ be the following configuration of a board with $N \times N$ disks:

Title: Special Partitions
Problem 333
Question: All positive integers can be partitioned in such a way that each and every term of the partition can be expressed as $2^i \times 3^j$, where $i,j \ge 0$.
Let's consider only such partitions where none of the terms can divide any of the other terms.
For example, the partition of $17 = 2 + 6 + 9 = (2^1 \times 3^0 + 2^1 \times 3^1 + 2^0 \times 3^2)$ would not be valid since $2$ can divide $6$. Neither would the partition $17 = 16 + 1 = (2^4 \times 3^0 + 2^0 \times 3^0)$ since $1$ can divide $16$. The only valid partition of $17$ would be $8 + 9 = (2^3 \times 3^0 + 2^0 \times 3^2)$.
Many integers have more than one valid partition, the first being $11$ having the following two partitions.
$11 = 2 + 9 = (2^1 \times 3^0 + 2^0 \times 3^2)$
$11 = 8 + 3 = (2^3 \times 3^0 + 2^0 \times 3^1)$
Let's define $P(n)$ as the number of valid partitions of $n$. For example, $P(11) = 2$.
Let's consider only the prime integers $q$ which would have a single valid partition such as $P(17)$.
The sum of the primes $q \lt 100$ such that $P(q)=1$ equals $233$.
Find the sum of the primes $q \lt 1000000$ such that $P(q)=1$.

Title: Spilling the Beans
Problem 334
Question: In Plato's heaven, there exist an infinite number of bowls in a straight line.
Each bowl either contains some or none of a finite number of beans.
A child plays a game, which allows only one kind of move: removing two beans from any bowl, and putting one in each of the two adjacent bowls. The game ends when each bowl contains either one or no beans.
For example, consider two adjacent bowls containing $2$ and $3$ beans respectively, all other bowls being empty. The following eight moves will finish the game:
You are given the following sequences:

$\def\htmltext#1{\style{font-family:inherit;}{\text{#1}}}$
$
\begin{align}
\qquad t_0 &= 123456,\cr
\qquad t_i &= \cases{
\;\;\frac{t_{i-1}}{2},&$\htmltext{if }t_{i-1}\htmltext{ is even}$\cr
\left\lfloor\frac{t_{i-1}}{2}\right\rfloor\oplus 926252,&$\htmltext{if }t_{i-1}\htmltext{ is odd}$\cr}\cr
&\qquad\htmltext{where }\lfloor x\rfloor\htmltext{ is the floor function }\cr
&\qquad\!\htmltext{and }\oplus\htmltext{is the bitwise XOR operator.}\cr
\qquad b_i &= (t_i\bmod2^{11}) + 1.\cr
\end{align}
$

The first two terms of the last sequence are $b_1 = 289$ and $b_2 = 145$.
If we start with $b_1$ and $b_2$ beans in two adjacent bowls, $3419100$ moves would be required to finish the game.
Consider now $1500$ adjacent bowls containing $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{1500}$ beans respectively, all other bowls being empty. Find how many moves it takes before the game ends.

Title: Gathering the Beans
Problem 335
Question: Whenever Peter feels bored, he places some bowls, containing one bean each, in a circle. After this, he takes all the beans out of a certain bowl and drops them one by one in the bowls going clockwise. He repeats this, starting from the bowl he dropped the last bean in, until the initial situation appears again. For example with 5 bowls he acts as follows:
So with $5$ bowls it takes Peter $15$ moves to return to the initial situation.
Let $M(x)$ represent the number of moves required to return to the initial situation, starting with $x$ bowls. Thus, $M(5) = 15$. It can also be verified that $M(100) = 10920$.
Find $\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{10^{18}} M(2^k + 1)$. Give your answer modulo $7^9$.

Title: Maximix Arrangements
Problem 336
Question: A train is used to transport four carriages in the order: ABCD. However, sometimes when the train arrives to collect the carriages they are not in the correct order. 
To rearrange the carriages they are all shunted on to a large rotating turntable. After the carriages are uncoupled at a specific point the train moves off the turntable pulling the carriages still attached with it. The remaining carriages are rotated 180 degrees. All of the carriages are then rejoined and this process is repeated as often as necessary in order to obtain the least number of uses of the turntable.
Some arrangements, such as ADCB, can be solved easily: the carriages are separated between A and D, and after DCB are rotated the correct order has been achieved.
However, Simple Simon, the train driver, is not known for his efficiency, so he always solves the problem by initially getting carriage A in the correct place, then carriage B, and so on.
Using four carriages, the worst possible arrangements for Simon, which we shall call maximix arrangements, are DACB and DBAC; each requiring him five rotations (although, using the most efficient approach, they could be solved using just three rotations). The process he uses for DACB is shown below.
It can be verified that there are 24 maximix arrangements for six carriages, of which the tenth lexicographic maximix arrangement is DFAECB.
Find the 2011th lexicographic maximix arrangement for eleven carriages.

Title: Cutting Rectangular Grid Paper
Problem 338
Question: A rectangular sheet of grid paper with integer dimensions $w \times h$ is given. Its grid spacing is $1$.
When we cut the sheet along the grid lines into two pieces and rearrange those pieces without overlap, we can make new rectangles with different dimensions.
For example, from a sheet with dimensions $9 \times 4$, we can make rectangles with dimensions $18 \times 2$, $12 \times 3$ and $6 \times 6$ by cutting and rearranging as below:
Similarly, from a sheet with dimensions $9 \times 8$, we can make rectangles with dimensions $18 \times 4$ and $12 \times 6$.
For a pair $w$ and $h$, let $F(w, h)$ be the number of distinct rectangles that can be made from a sheet with dimensions $w \times h$.
For example, $F(2,1) = 0$, $F(2,2) = 1$, $F(9,4) = 3$ and $F(9,8) = 2$. 
Note that rectangles congruent to the initial one are not counted in $F(w, h)$.
Note also that rectangles with dimensions $w \times h$ and dimensions $h \times w$ are not considered distinct.
For an integer $N$, let $G(N)$ be the sum of $F(w, h)$ for all pairs $w$ and $h$ which satisfy $0 \lt h \le w \le N$.
We can verify that $G(10) = 55$, $G(10^3) = 971745$ and $G(10^5) = 9992617687$.
Find $G(10^{12})$. Give your answer modulo $10^8$.

Title: Peredur Fab Efrawg
Problem 339
Question: 
"And he came towards a valley, through which ran a river; and the borders of the valley were wooded, and on each side of the river were level meadows. And on one side of the river he saw a flock of white sheep, and on the other a flock of black sheep. And whenever one of the white sheep bleated, one of the black sheep would cross over and become white; and when one of the black sheep bleated, one of the white sheep would cross over and become black."en.wikisource.org



Initially each flock consists of $n$ sheep. Each sheep (regardless of colour) is equally likely to be the next sheep to bleat. After a sheep has bleated and a sheep from the other flock has crossed over, Peredur may remove a number of white sheep in order to maximize the expected final number of black sheep. Let $E(n)$ be the expected final number of black sheep if Peredur uses an optimal strategy.

Title: Fractional Sequences
Problem 343
Question: For any positive integer $k$, a finite sequence $a_i$ of fractions $x_i/y_i$ is defined by:
$a_1 = 1/k$ and
$a_i = (x_{i - 1} + 1) / (y_{i - 1} - 1)$ reduced to lowest terms for $i \gt 1$.
When $a_i$ reaches some integer $n$, the sequence stops. (That is, when $y_i = 1$.)
Define $f(k) = n$. 
For example, for $k = 20$:


$1/20 \to 2/19 \to 3/18 = 1/6 \to 2/5 \to 3/4 \to 4/3 \to 5/2 \to 6/1 = 6$


So $f(20) = 6$.


Also $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 2$, $f(3) = 1$ and $\sum f(k^3) = 118937$ for $1 \le k \le 100$.

Title: Silver Dollar Game
Problem 344
Question: One variant of N.G. de Bruijn's silver dollar game can be described as follows:
On a strip of squares a number of coins are placed, at most one coin per square. Only one coin, called the silver dollar, has any value. Two players take turns making moves. At each turn a player must make either a regular or a special move.
A regular move consists of selecting one coin and moving it one or more squares to the left. The coin cannot move out of the strip or jump on or over another coin.
Alternatively, the player can choose to make the special move of pocketing the leftmost coin rather than making a regular move. If no regular moves are possible, the player is forced to pocket the leftmost coin.
The winner is the player who pockets the silver dollar.
A winning configuration is an arrangement of coins on the strip where the first player can force a win no matter what the second player does.
Let $W(n,c)$ be the number of winning configurations for a strip of $n$ squares, $c$ worthless coins and one silver dollar.
You are given that $W(10,2) = 324$ and $W(100,10) = 1514704946113500$.
Find $W(1\,000\,000, 100)$ modulo the semiprime $1000\,036\,000\,099$ ($= 1\,000\,003 \cdot 1\,000\,033$).

The largest integer $\le 100$ that is only divisible by both the primes $2$ and $3$ is $96$, as $96=32\times 3=2^5 \times 3$.
For two distinct primes $p$ and $q$ let $M(p,q,N)$ be the largest positive integer $\le N$ only divisible by both $p$ and $q$ and $M(p,q,N)=0$ if such a positive integer does not exist.


E.g. $M(2,3,100)=96$. 
$M(3,5,100)=75$ and not $90$ because $90$ is divisible by $2$, $3$ and $5$.
Also $M(2,73,100)=0$ because there does not exist a positive integer $\le 100$ that is divisible by both $2$ and $73$.


Let $S(N)$ be the sum of all distinct $M(p,q,N)$.

Title: Constraining the Least Greatest and the Greatest Least
Problem 350
Question: A list of size $n$ is a sequence of $n$ natural numbers. Examples are $(2,4,6)$, $(2,6,4)$, $(10,6,15,6)$, and $(11)$.


The greatest common divisor, or $\gcd$, of a list is the largest natural number that divides all entries of the list. Examples: $\gcd(2,6,4) = 2$, $\gcd(10,6,15,6) = 1$ and $\gcd(11) = 11$.


The least common multiple, or $\operatorname{lcm}$, of a list is the smallest natural number divisible by each entry of the list. Examples: $\operatorname{lcm}(2,6,4) = 12$, $\operatorname{lcm}(10,6,15,6) = 30$ and $\operatorname{lcm}(11) = 11$.


Let $f(G, L, N)$ be the number of lists of size $N$ with $\gcd \ge G$ and $\operatorname{lcm} \le L$. For example:

Title: Blood Tests
Problem 352
Question: 
Each one of the $25$ sheep in a flock must be tested for a rare virus, known to affect $2\%$ of the sheep population.
An accurate and extremely sensitive PCR test exists for blood samples, producing a clear positive / negative result, but it is very time-consuming and expensive.


Because of the high cost, the vet-in-charge suggests that instead of performing $25$ separate tests, the following procedure can be used instead:
The sheep are split into $5$ groups of $5$ sheep in each group. 
For each group, the $5$ samples are mixed together and a single test is performed. Then,


Since the probability of infection for any specific animal is only $0.02$, the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:


Thus, the expected number of tests for each group is $1 + 0.0960792032 \times 5 = 1.480396016$.
Consequently, all $5$ groups can be screened using an average of only $1.480396016 \times 5 = \mathbf{7.40198008}$ tests, which represents a huge saving of more than $70\%$!


Although the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by mixing different samples). E.g.:


To simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction we place when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we start with a mixed sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample must be fully screened (i.e. a verdict of infected / virus-free must be reached for all of them) before we start examining any other animals.


Using the optimal strategy, let $T(s,p)$ represent the average number of tests needed to screen a flock of $s$ sheep for a virus having probability $p$ to be present in any individual.
Thus, rounded to six decimal places, $T(25, 0.02) = 4.155452$ and $T(25, 0.10) = 12.702124$.


Find $\sum T(10000, p)$ for $p=0.01, 0.02, 0.03, \dots 0.50$.

Title: Risky Moon
Problem 353
Question: 
A moon could be described by the sphere $C(r)$ with centre $(0,0,0)$ and radius $r$. 


There are stations on the moon at the points on the surface of $C(r)$ with integer coordinates. The station at $(0,0,r)$ is called North Pole station, the station at $(0,0,-r)$ is called South Pole station.


All stations are connected with each other via the shortest road on the great arc through the stations. A journey between two stations is risky. If d is the length of the road between two stations, $\left(\frac{d}{\pi r}\right)^2$ is a measure for the risk of the journey (let us call it the risk of the road). If the journey includes more than two stations, the risk of the journey is the sum of risks of the used roads.


A direct journey from  the North Pole station to the South Pole station has the length $\pi r$ and risk $1$. The journey from the North Pole station to the South Pole station via $(0,r,0)$ has the same length, but a smaller risk:

The minimal risk of a journey from the North Pole station to the South Pole station on $C(r)$ is $M(r)$.

When it is multiplied by $1, 2, 3, 4, \dots, n$, all the products have exactly the same digits, in the same order, but rotated in a circular fashion!


The smallest cyclic number is the $6$-digit number $142857$:
$142857 \times 1 = 142857$
$142857 \times 2 = 285714$
$142857 \times 3 = 428571$
$142857 \times 4 = 571428$
$142857 \times 5 = 714285$
$142857 \times 6 = 857142$


The next cyclic number is $0588235294117647$ with $16$ digits :
$0588235294117647 \times 1 = 0588235294117647$
$0588235294117647 \times 2 = 1176470588235294$
$0588235294117647 \times 3 = 1764705882352941$
$\dots$
$0588235294117647 \times 16 = 9411764705882352$


Note that for cyclic numbers, leading zeros are important.


There is only one cyclic number for which, the eleven leftmost digits are $00000000137$ and the five rightmost digits are $56789$ (i.e., it has the form $00000000137 \cdots 56789$ with an unknown number of digits in the middle). Find the sum of all its digits.

Title: Hilbert's New Hotel
Problem 359
Question: 
An infinite number of people (numbered $1$, $2$, $3$, etc.) are lined up to get a room at Hilbert's newest infinite hotel. The hotel contains an infinite number of floors (numbered $1$, $2$, $3$, etc.), and each floor contains an infinite number of rooms (numbered $1$, $2$, $3$, etc.). 


Initially the hotel is empty. Hilbert declares a rule on how the $n$th person is assigned a room: person $n$ gets the first vacant room in the lowest numbered floor satisfying either of the following:


Person $1$ gets room $1$ in floor $1$ since floor $1$ is empty.
Person $2$ does not get room $2$ in floor $1$ since $1 + 2 = 3$ is not a perfect square.
Person $2$ instead gets room $1$ in floor $2$ since floor $2$ is empty.
Person $3$ gets room $2$ in floor $1$ since $1 + 3 = 4$ is a perfect square.


Eventually, every person in the line gets a room in the hotel.


Define $P(f, r)$ to be $n$ if person $n$ occupies room $r$ in floor $f$, and $0$ if no person occupies the room. Here are a few examples:
$P(1, 1) = 1$
$P(1, 2) = 3$
$P(2, 1) = 2$
$P(10, 20) = 440$
$P(25, 75) = 4863$
$P(99, 100) = 19454$


Find the sum of all $P(f, r)$ for all positive $f$ and $r$ such that $f \times r = 71328803586048$ and give the last $8$ digits as your answer.

Title: Scary Sphere
Problem 360
Question: 
Given two points $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ in three dimensional space, the Manhattan distance between those points is defined as$|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| + |z_1 - z_2|$.


Let $C(r)$ be a sphere with radius $r$ and center in the origin $O(0,0,0)$.
Let $I(r)$ be the set of all points with integer coordinates on the surface of $C(r)$.
Let $S(r)$ be the sum of the Manhattan distances of all elements of $I(r)$ to the origin $O$.


E.g. $S(45)=34518$.

Title: Subsequence of Thue-Morse Sequence
Problem 361
Question: The Thue-Morse sequence $\{T_n\}$ is a binary sequence satisfying:

The first several terms of $\{T_n\}$ are given as follows:
$01101001{\color{red}10010}1101001011001101001\cdots$


We define $\{A_n\}$ as the sorted sequence of integers such that the binary expression of each element appears as a subsequence in $\{T_n\}$.
For example, the decimal number $18$ is expressed as $10010$ in binary. $10010$ appears in $\{T_n\}$ ($T_8$ to $T_{12}$), so $18$ is an element of $\{A_n\}$.
The decimal number $14$ is expressed as $1110$ in binary. $1110$ never appears in $\{T_n\}$, so $14$ is not an element of $\{A_n\}$.


The first several terms of $\{A_n\}$ are given as follows:

We can also verify that $A_{100} = 3251$ and $A_{1000} = 80852364498$.


Find the last $9$ digits of $\sum \limits_{k = 1}^{18} A_{10^k}$.

Title: Squarefree Factors
Problem 362
Question: 
Consider the number $54$.
$54$ can be factored in $7$ distinct ways into one or more factors larger than $1$:
$54$, $2 \times 27$, $3 \times 18$, $6 \times 9$, $3 \times 3 \times 6$, $2 \times 3 \times 9$ and $2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$.
If we require that the factors are all squarefree only two ways remain: $3 \times 3 \times 6$ and $2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$.


Let's call $\operatorname{Fsf}(n)$ the number of ways $n$ can be factored into one or more squarefree factors larger than $1$, so
$\operatorname{Fsf}(54)=2$.


Let $S(n)$ be $\sum \operatorname{Fsf}(k)$ for $k=2$ to $n$.


$S(100)=193$.

Title: Bézier Curves
Problem 363
Question: A cubic Bézier curve is defined by four points: $P_0, P_1, P_2,$ and $P_3$.
The curve is constructed as follows:
On the segments $P_0 P_1$, $P_1 P_2$, and $P_2 P_3$ the points $Q_0, Q_1,$ and $Q_2$ are drawn such that $\dfrac{P_0 Q_0}{P_0 P_1} = \dfrac{P_1 Q_1}{P_1 P_2} = \dfrac{P_2 Q_2}{P_2 P_3} = t$, with $t$ in $[0, 1]$.
On the segments $Q_0 Q_1$ and $Q_1 Q_2$ the points $R_0$ and $R_1$ are drawn such that
$\dfrac{Q_0 R_0}{Q_0 Q_1} = \dfrac{Q_1 R_1}{Q_1 Q_2} = t$ for the same value of $t$.
On the segment $R_0 R_1$ the point $B$ is drawn such that $\dfrac{R_0 B}{R_0 R_1} = t$ for the same value of $t$.
The Bézier curve defined by the points $P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$ is the locus of $B$ as $Q_0$ takes all possible positions on the segment $P_0 P_1$.
(Please note that for all points the value of $t$ is the same.)
From the construction it is clear that the Bézier curve will be tangent to the segments $P_0 P_1$ in $P_0$ and $P_2 P_3$ in $P_3$.
A cubic Bézier curve with $P_0 = (1, 0), P_1 = (1, v), P_2 = (v, 1),$ and $P_3 = (0, 1)$ is used to approximate a quarter circle.
The value $v \gt 0$ is chosen such that the area enclosed by the lines $O P_0, OP_3$ and the curve is equal to $\dfrac{\pi}{4}$ (the area of the quarter circle).
By how many percent does the length of the curve differ from the length of the quarter circle?
That is, if $L$ is the length of the curve, calculate $100 \times \dfrac{L - \frac{\pi}{2}}{\frac{\pi}{2}}$

Title: Stone Game III
Problem 366
Question: 
Two players, Anton and Bernhard, are playing the following game.
There is one pile of $n$ stones.
The first player may remove any positive number of stones, but not the whole pile.
Thereafter, each player may remove at most twice the number of stones his opponent took on the previous move.
The player who removes the last stone wins.


E.g. $n=5$.
If the first player takes anything more than one stone the next player will be able to take all remaining stones.
If the first player takes one stone, leaving four, his opponent will take also one stone, leaving three stones.
The first player cannot take all three because he may take at most $2 \times 1=2$ stones. So let's say he takes also one stone, leaving $2$. The second player can take the two remaining stones and wins.
So $5$ is a losing position for the first player.
For some winning positions there is more than one possible move for the first player.
E.g. when $n=17$ the first player can remove one or four stones.


Let $M(n)$ be the maximum number of stones the first player can take from a winning position at his first turn and $M(n)=0$ for any other position.


$\sum M(n)$ for $n \le 100$ is $728$.


Find $\sum M(n)$ for $n \le 10^{18}$.

Title: Bozo Sort
Problem 367
Question: 
Bozo sort, not to be confused with the slightly less efficient bogo sort, consists out of checking if the input sequence is sorted and if not swapping randomly two elements. This is repeated until eventually the sequence is sorted.


If we consider all permutations of the first $4$ natural numbers as input the expectation value of the number of swaps, averaged over all $4!$ input sequences is $24.75$.
The already sorted sequence takes $0$ steps. 


In this problem we consider the following variant on bozo sort.
If the sequence is not in order we pick three elements at random and shuffle these three elements randomly.
All $3!=6$ permutations of those three elements are equally likely. 
The already sorted sequence will take $0$ steps.
If we consider all permutations of the first $4$ natural numbers as input the expectation value of the number of shuffles, averaged over all $4!$ input sequences is $27.5$. 
Consider as input sequences the permutations of the first $11$ natural numbers.
Averaged over all $11!$ input sequences, what is the expected number of shuffles this sorting algorithm will perform?

Title: A Kempner-like Series
Problem 368
Question: The harmonic series $1 + \frac 1 2 + \frac 1 3 + \frac 1 4 + \cdots$ is well known to be divergent.
If we however omit from this series every term where the denominator has a $9$ in it, the series remarkably enough converges to approximately $22.9206766193$.
This modified harmonic series is called the Kempner series.
Let us now consider another modified harmonic series by omitting from the harmonic series every term where the denominator has $3$ or more equal consecutive digits.
One can verify that out of the first $1200$ terms of the harmonic series, only $20$ terms will be omitted.
These $20$ omitted terms are:
$$\frac 1 {111}, \frac 1 {222}, \frac 1 {333}, \frac 1 {444}, \frac 1 {555}, \frac 1 {666}, \frac 1 {777}, \frac 1 {888}, \frac 1 {999}, \frac 1 {1000}, \frac 1 {1110},$$

This series converges as well.
Find the value the series converges to.

Title: Maximum Integer Partition Product
Problem 374
Question: An integer partition of a number $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers.
Partitions that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same.
A partition of $n$ into distinct parts is a partition of $n$ in which every part occurs at most once.
The partitions of $5$ into distinct parts are:
$5$, $4+1$ and $3+2$.
Let $f(n)$ be the maximum product of the parts of any such partition of $n$ into distinct parts and let $m(n)$ be the number of elements of any such partition of $n$ with that product.
So $f(5)=6$ and $m(5)=2$.
For $n=10$ the partition with the largest product is $10=2+3+5$, which gives $f(10)=30$ and $m(10)=3$.
And their product, $f(10) \cdot m(10) = 30 \cdot 3 = 90$.
It can be verified that
$\sum f(n) \cdot m(n)$ for $1 \le n \le 100 = 1683550844462$.
Find $\sum f(n) \cdot m(n)$ for $1 \le n \le 10^{14}$.

Title: Nontransitive Sets of Dice
Problem 376
Question: 
Consider the following set of dice with nonstandard pips:


Die $A$: $1$ $4$ $4$ $4$ $4$ $4$
Die $B$: $2$ $2$ $2$ $5$ $5$ $5$
Die $C$: $3$ $3$ $3$ $3$ $3$ $6$

A game is played by two players picking a die in turn and rolling it. The player who rolls the highest value wins.


If the first player picks die $A$ and the second player picks die $B$ we get
$P(\text{second player wins}) = 7/12 \gt 1/2$.

If the first player picks die $B$ and the second player picks die $C$ we get
$P(\text{second player wins}) = 7/12 \gt 1/2$.

If the first player picks die $C$ and the second player picks die $A$ we get
$P(\text{second player wins}) = 25/36 \gt 1/2$.

So whatever die the first player picks, the second player can pick another die and have a larger than $50\%$ chance of winning.
A set of dice having this property is called a nontransitive set of dice.


We wish to investigate how many sets of nontransitive dice exist. We will assume the following conditions:

For $N = 7$ we find there are $9780$ such sets.
How many are there for $N = 30$?

Title: Generating Polygons
Problem 382
Question: 
A polygon is a flat shape consisting of straight line segments that are joined to form a closed chain or circuit. A polygon consists of at least three sides and does not self-intersect.


A set $S$ of positive numbers is said to generate a polygon $P$ if:

For example:
The set $\{3, 4, 5\}$ generates a polygon with sides $3$, $4$, and $5$ (a triangle).
The set $\{6, 9, 11, 24\}$ generates a polygon with sides $6$, $9$, $11$, and $24$ (a quadrilateral).
The sets $\{1, 2, 3\}$ and $\{2, 3, 4, 9\}$ do not generate any polygon at all.

Consider the sequence $s$, defined as follows:

Let $U_n$ be the set $\{s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n\}$. For example, $U_{10} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 13, 19, 28, 41\}$.

Title: Rudin-Shapiro Sequence
Problem 384
Question: Define the sequence $a(n)$ as the number of adjacent pairs of ones in the binary expansion of $n$ (possibly overlapping).
E.g.: $a(5) = a(101_2) = 0$, $a(6) = a(110_2) = 1$, $a(7) = a(111_2) = 2$.
Define the sequence $b(n) = (-1)^{a(n)}$.
This sequence is called the Rudin-Shapiro sequence.
Also consider the summatory sequence of $b(n)$: $s(n) = \sum \limits_{i = 0}^n b(i)$.
The first couple of values of these sequences are:
The sequence $s(n)$ has the remarkable property that all elements are positive and every positive integer $k$ occurs exactly $k$ times.
Define $g(t,c)$, with $1 \le c \le t$, as the index in $s(n)$ for which $t$ occurs for the $c$'th time in $s(n)$.
E.g.: $g(3,3) = 6$, $g(4,2) = 7$ and $g(54321,12345) = 1220847710$.
Let $F(n)$ be the Fibonacci sequence defined by:
$F(0)=F(1)=1$ and
$F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2)$ for $n \gt 1$.
Define $GF(t)=g(F(t),F(t-1))$.
Find $\sum GF(t)$ for $2 \le t \le 45$.

Title: Ellipses Inside Triangles
Problem 385
Question: 
For any triangle $T$ in the plane, it can be shown that there is a unique ellipse with largest area that is completely inside $T$.




For a given $n$, consider triangles $T$ such that:
- the vertices of $T$ have integer coordinates with absolute value $\le n$, and 
- the foci1 of the largest-area ellipse inside $T$ are $(\sqrt{13},0)$ and $(-\sqrt{13},0)$.
Let $A(n)$ be the sum of the areas of all such triangles.


For example, if $n = 8$, there are two such triangles. Their vertices are $(-4,-3),(-4,3),(8,0)$ and $(4,3),(4,-3),(-8,0)$, and the area of each triangle is $36$. Thus $A(8) = 36 + 36 = 72$.


It can be verified that $A(10) = 252$, $A(100) = 34632$ and $A(1000) = 3529008$.


Find $A(1\,000\,000\,000)$.


1The foci (plural of focus) of an ellipse are two points $A$ and $B$ such that for every point $P$ on the boundary of the ellipse, $AP + PB$ is constant.

Title: Maximum Length of an Antichain
Problem 386
Question: Let $n$ be an integer and $S(n)$ be the set of factors of $n$.
A subset $A$ of $S(n)$ is called an antichain of $S(n)$ if $A$ contains only one element or if none of the elements of $A$ divides any of the other elements of $A$.
For example: $S(30) = \{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30\}$.
$\{2, 5, 6\}$ is not an antichain of $S(30)$.
$\{2, 3, 5\}$ is an antichain of $S(30)$.
Let $N(n)$ be the maximum length of an antichain of $S(n)$.
Find $\sum N(n)$ for $1 \le n \le 10^8$.

Title: Harshad Numbers
Problem 387
Question: A Harshad or Niven number is a number that is divisible by the sum of its digits.
$201$ is a Harshad number because it is divisible by $3$ (the sum of its digits.)
When we truncate the last digit from $201$, we get $20$, which is a Harshad number.
When we truncate the last digit from $20$, we get $2$, which is also a Harshad number.
Let's call a Harshad number that, while recursively truncating the last digit, always results in a Harshad number a right truncatable Harshad number.
Also:
$201/3=67$ which is prime.
Let's call a Harshad number that, when divided by the sum of its digits, results in a prime a strong Harshad number.
Now take the number $2011$ which is prime.
When we truncate the last digit from it we get $201$, a strong Harshad number that is also right truncatable.
Let's call such primes strong, right truncatable Harshad primes.
You are given that the sum of the strong, right truncatable Harshad primes less than $10000$ is $90619$.
Find the sum of the strong, right truncatable Harshad primes less than $10^{14}$.

Title: Hopping Game
Problem 391
Question: Let $s_k$ be the number of 1’s when writing the numbers from 0 to $k$ in binary.
For example, writing 0 to 5 in binary, we have $0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101$. There are seven 1’s, so $s_5 = 7$.
The sequence $S = \{s_k : k \ge 0\}$ starts $\{0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, ...\}$.
A game is played by two players. Before the game starts, a number $n$ is chosen. A counter $c$ starts at 0. At each turn, the player chooses a number from 1 to $n$ (inclusive) and increases $c$ by that number. The resulting value of $c$ must be a member of $S$. If there are no more valid moves, then the player loses.
For example, with $n = 5$ and starting with $c = 0$:
Player 1 chooses 4, so $c$ becomes $0 + 4 = 4$.
Player 2 chooses 5, so $c$ becomes $4 + 5 = 9$.
Player 1 chooses 3, so $c$ becomes $9 + 3 = 12$.
etc.
Note that $c$ must always belong to $S$, and each player can increase $c$ by at most $n$.
Let $M(n)$ be the highest number that the first player could choose at the start to force a win, and $M(n) = 0$ if there is no such move. For example, $M(2) = 2$, $M(7) = 1$, and $M(20) = 4$.
It can be verified that $\sum{M(n)^3} = 8150$ for $1 \le n \le 20$.
Find $\sum{M(n)^3}$ for $1 \le n \le 1000$.

Title: Eating Pie
Problem 394
Question: 
Jeff eats a pie in an unusual way.
The pie is circular. He starts with slicing an initial cut in the pie along a radius.
While there is at least a given fraction $F$ of pie left, he performs the following procedure:
- He makes two slices from the pie centre to any point of what is remaining of the pie border, any point on the remaining pie border equally likely. This will divide the remaining pie into three pieces. 
- Going counterclockwise from the initial cut, he takes the first two pie pieces and eats them.
When less than a fraction $F$ of pie remains, he does not repeat this procedure. Instead, he eats all of the remaining pie.




For $x \ge 1$, let $E(x)$ be the expected number of times Jeff repeats the procedure above with $F = 1/x$.
It can be verified that $E(1) = 1$, $E(2) \approx 1.2676536759$, and $E(7.5) \approx 2.1215732071$.

Title: Squarefree Fibonacci Numbers
Problem 399
Question: 
The first $15$ Fibonacci numbers are:
$1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610$.
It can be seen that $8$ and $144$ are not squarefree: $8$ is divisible by $4$ and $144$ is divisible by $4$ and by $9$. 
So the first $13$ squarefree Fibonacci numbers are:
$1,1,2,3,5,13,21,34,55,89,233,377$ and $610$.


The $200$th squarefree Fibonacci number is:
$971183874599339129547649988289594072811608739584170445$.
The last sixteen digits of this number are: $1608739584170445$ and in scientific notation this number can be written as $9.7\mathrm e53$.


Find the $100\,000\,000$th squarefree Fibonacci number.
Give as your answer its last sixteen digits followed by a comma followed by the number in scientific notation (rounded to one digit after the decimal point).
For the $200$th squarefree number the answer would have been: 1608739584170445,9.7e53



Note: 
For this problem, assume that for every prime $p$, the first fibonacci number divisible by $p$ is not divisible by $p^2$ (this is part of Wall's conjecture). This has been verified for primes $\le 3 \cdot 10^{15}$, but has not been proven in general.

If it happens that the conjecture is false, then the accepted answer to this problem isn't guaranteed to be the $100\,000\,000$th squarefree Fibonacci number, rather it represents only a lower bound for that number.

Title: Guessing Game
Problem 406
Question: We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ by asking questions. 
Each number (question) we ask, we get one of three possible answers:
Given the value of $n$, $a$, and $b$, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost for the worst possible case.
For example, if $n = 5$, $a = 2$, and $b = 3$, then we may begin by asking "2" as our first question.
If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of b=3), then we are sure that "1" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 3).
If we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of a=2), then our next question will be "4".
If we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of b=3), then we are sure that "3" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+3=5).
If we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of a=2), then we are sure that "5" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+2=4).
Thus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is 5. It can also be shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved. 
So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for the given values of $n$, $a$, and $b$.
Let $C(n, a, b)$ be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for the given values of $n$, $a$ and $b$.
Here are a few examples:
$C(5, 2, 3) = 5$
$C(500, \sqrt 2, \sqrt 3) = 13.22073197\dots$
$C(20000, 5, 7) = 82$
$C(2000000, \sqrt 5, \sqrt 7) = 49.63755955\dots$
Let $F_k$ be the Fibonacci numbers: $F_k=F_{k-1}+F_{k-2}$ with base cases $F_1=F_2= 1$.Find $\displaystyle \sum \limits_{k = 1}^{30} {C \left (10^{12}, \sqrt{k}, \sqrt{F_k} \right )}$, and give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.

For example, $(9, 16)$ is inadmissible, while $(0, 4)$, $(3, 1)$ and $(9, 4)$ are not.
Consider a path from point $(x_1, y_1)$ to point $(x_2, y_2)$ using only unit steps north or east.
Let's call such a path admissible if none of its intermediate points are inadmissible.
Let $P(n)$ be the number of admissible paths from $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$.
It can be verified that $P(5) = 252$, $P(16) = 596994440$ and $P(1000) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007 = 341920854$.
Find $P(10\,000\,000) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007$.

Title: Circle and Tangent Line
Problem 410
Question: Let $C$ be the circle with radius $r$, $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$. We choose two points $P(a, b)$ and $Q(-a, c)$ so that the line passing through $P$ and $Q$ is tangent to $C$.
For example, the quadruplet $(r, a, b, c) = (2, 6, 2, -7)$ satisfies this property.
Let $F(R, X)$ be the number of the integer quadruplets $(r, a, b, c)$ with this property, and with $0 \lt r \leq R$ and $0 \lt a \leq X$.
We can verify that $F(1, 5) = 10$, $F(2, 10) = 52$ and $F(10, 100) = 3384$.
Find $F(10^8, 10^9) + F(10^9, 10^8)$.

Title: Uphill Paths
Problem 411
Question: 
Let $n$ be a positive integer. Suppose there are stations at the coordinates $(x, y) = (2^i \bmod n, 3^i \bmod n)$ for $0 \leq i \leq 2n$. We will consider stations with the same coordinates as the same station.


We wish to form a path from $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$ such that the $x$ and $y$ coordinates never decrease.
Let $S(n)$ be the maximum number of stations such a path can pass through.


For example, if $n = 22$, there are $11$ distinct stations, and a valid path can pass through at most $5$ stations. Therefore, $S(22) = 5$.
The case is illustrated below, with an example of an optimal path:



It can also be verified that $S(123) = 14$ and $S(10000) = 48$.


Find $\sum S(k^5)$ for $1 \leq k \leq 30$.

Title: Gnomon Numbering
Problem 412
Question: For integers $m, n$ ($0 \leq n \lt m$), let $L(m, n)$ be an $m \times m$ grid with the top-right $n \times n$ grid removed.
For example, $L(5, 3)$ looks like this:

We want to number each cell of $L(m, n)$ with consecutive integers $1, 2, 3, \dots$ such that the number in every cell is smaller than the number below it and to the left of it.
For example, here are two valid numberings of $L(5, 3)$:

Let $\operatorname{LC}(m, n)$ be the number of valid numberings of $L(m, n)$.
It can be verified that $\operatorname{LC}(3, 0) = 42$, $\operatorname{LC}(5, 3) = 250250$, $\operatorname{LC}(6, 3) = 406029023400$ and $\operatorname{LC}(10, 5) \bmod 76543217 = 61251715$.

Title: One-child Numbers
Problem 413
Question: We say that a $d$-digit positive number (no leading zeros) is a one-child number if exactly one of its sub-strings is divisible by $d$.
For example, $5671$ is a $4$-digit one-child number. Among all its sub-strings $5$, $6$, $7$, $1$, $56$, $67$, $71$, $567$, $671$ and $5671$, only $56$ is divisible by $4$.
Similarly, $104$ is a $3$-digit one-child number because only $0$ is divisible by $3$.
$1132451$ is a $7$-digit one-child number because only $245$ is divisible by $7$.
Let $F(N)$ be the number of the one-child numbers less than $N$.
We can verify that $F(10) = 9$, $F(10^3) = 389$ and $F(10^7) = 277674$.
Find $F(10^{19})$.

Title: Kaprekar Constant
Problem 414
Question: 
$6174$ is a remarkable number; if we sort its digits in increasing order and subtract that number from the number you get when you sort the digits in decreasing order, we get $7641-1467=6174$.
Even more remarkable is that if we start from any $4$ digit number and repeat this process of sorting and subtracting, we'll eventually end up with $6174$ or immediately with $0$ if all digits are equal. 
This also works with numbers that have less than $4$ digits if we pad the number with leading zeroes until we have $4$ digits.
E.g. let's start with the number $0837$:
$8730-0378=8352$
$8532-2358=6174$


$6174$ is called the Kaprekar constant. The process of sorting and subtracting and repeating this until either $0$ or the Kaprekar constant is reached is called the Kaprekar routine.


We can consider the Kaprekar routine for other bases and number of digits. 
Unfortunately, it is not guaranteed a Kaprekar constant exists in all cases; either the routine can end up in a cycle for some input numbers or the constant the routine arrives at can be different for different input numbers.
However, it can be shown that for $5$ digits and a base $b = 6t+3\neq 9$, a Kaprekar constant exists.
E.g. base $15$: $(10,4,14,9,5)_{15}$
base $21$: $(14,6,20,13,7)_{21}$

Define $C_b$ to be the Kaprekar constant in base $b$ for $5$ digits.
Define the function $sb(i)$ to be


Define $S(b)$ as the sum of $sb(i)$ for $0 \lt i \lt b^5$.
E.g. $S(15) = 5274369$
$S(111) = 400668930299$


Find the sum of $S(6k+3)$ for $2 \leq k \leq 300$.
Give the last $18$ digits as your answer.

Title: Titanic Sets
Problem 415
Question: A set of lattice points $S$ is called a titanic set if there exists a line passing through exactly two points in $S$.
An example of a titanic set is $S = \{(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0)\}$, where the line passing through $(0, 1)$ and $(2, 0)$ does not pass through any other point in $S$.
On the other hand, the set $\{(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4)\}$ is not a titanic set since the line passing through any two points in the set also passes through the other two.
For any positive integer $N$, let $T(N)$ be the number of titanic sets $S$ whose every point $(x, y)$ satisfies $0 \leq x, y \leq N$.
It can be verified that $T(1) = 11$, $T(2) = 494$, $T(4) = 33554178$, $T(111) \bmod 10^8 = 13500401$ and $T(10^5) \bmod 10^8 = 63259062$.

Title: A Frog's Trip
Problem 416
Question: A row of $n$ squares contains a frog in the leftmost square. By successive jumps the frog goes to the rightmost square and then back to the leftmost square. On the outward trip he jumps one, two or three squares to the right, and on the homeward trip he jumps to the left in a similar manner. He cannot jump outside the squares. He repeats the round-trip travel $m$ times.
Let $F(m, n)$ be the number of the ways the frog can travel so that at most one square remains unvisited.
For example, $F(1, 3) = 4$, $F(1, 4) = 15$, $F(1, 5) = 46$, $F(2, 3) = 16$ and $F(2, 100) \bmod 10^9 = 429619151$.

Where $0.1(6)$ means $0.166666\cdots$, and has a $1$-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that $1/7$ has a $6$-digit recurring cycle.

Unit fractions whose denominator has no other prime factors than $2$ and/or $5$ are not considered to have a recurring cycle.
We define the length of the recurring cycle of those unit fractions as $0$.


Let $L(n)$ denote the length of the recurring cycle of $1/n$.
You are given that $\sum L(n)$ for $3 \leq n \leq 1\,000\,000$ equals $55535191115$.

Title: Look and Say Sequence
Problem 419
Question: 
The look and say sequence goes 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221, 1113213211, ...
The sequence starts with 1 and all other members are obtained by describing the previous member in terms of consecutive digits.
It helps to do this out loud:
1 is 'one one' → 11
11 is 'two ones' → 21
21 is 'one two and one one' → 1211 
1211 is 'one one, one two and two ones' → 111221
111221 is 'three ones, two twos and one one' → 312211
...


Define $A(n)$, $B(n)$ and $C(n)$ as the number of ones, twos and threes in the $n$'th element of the sequence respectively.
One can verify that $A(40) = 31254$, $B(40) = 20259$ and $C(40) = 11625$.


Find $A(n)$, $B(n)$ and $C(n)$ for $n = 10^{12}$.
Give your answer modulo $2^{30}$ and separate your values for $A$, $B$ and $C$ by a comma.
E.g. for $n = 40$ the answer would be 31254,20259,11625

Question: Let $H$ be the hyperbola defined by the equation $12x^2 + 7xy - 12y^2 = 625$.
Next, define $X$ as the point $(7, 1)$. It can be seen that $X$ is in $H$.
Now we define a sequence of points in $H$, $\{P_i: i \geq 1\}$, as:

You are given that $P_3 = (-19/2, -229/24)$, $P_4 = (1267/144, -37/12)$ and $P_7 = (17194218091/143327232, 274748766781/1719926784)$.
Find $P_n$ for $n = 11^{14}$ in the following format:If $P_n = (a/b, c/d)$ where the fractions are in lowest terms and the denominators are positive, then the answer is $(a + b + c + d) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007$.

Title: Consecutive Die Throws
Problem 423
Question: Let $n$ be a positive integer.
A 6-sided die is thrown $n$ times. Let $c$ be the number of pairs of consecutive throws that give the same value.
For example, if $n = 7$ and the values of the die throws are (1,1,5,6,6,6,3), then the following pairs of consecutive throws give the same value:
(1,1,5,6,6,6,3)
(1,1,5,6,6,6,3)
(1,1,5,6,6,6,3)
Therefore, $c = 3$ for (1,1,5,6,6,6,3).
Define $C(n)$ as the number of outcomes of throwing a 6-sided die $n$ times such that $c$ does not exceed $\pi(n)$.1
For example, $C(3) = 216$, $C(4) = 1290$, $C(11) = 361912500$ and $C(24) = 4727547363281250000$.
Define $S(L)$ as $\sum C(n)$ for $1 \leq n \leq L$.
For example, $S(50) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007 = 832833871$.
Find $S(50\,000\,000) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007$.

Title: Kakuro
Problem 424
Question: The above is an example of a cryptic kakuro (also known as cross sums, or even sums cross) puzzle, with its final solution on the right. (The common rules of kakuro puzzles can be found easily on numerous internet sites. Other related information can also be currently found at krazydad.com whose author has provided the puzzle data for this challenge.)
The downloadable text file (kakuro200.txt) contains the description of 200 such puzzles, a mix of 5x5 and 6x6 types. The first puzzle in the file is the above example which is coded as follows:
6,X,X,(vCC),(vI),X,X,X,(hH),B,O,(vCA),(vJE),X,(hFE,vD),O,O,O,O,(hA),O,I,(hJC,vB),O,O,(hJC),H,O,O,O,X,X,X,(hJE),O,O,X
The first character is a numerical digit indicating the size of the information grid. It would be either a 6 (for a 5x5 kakuro puzzle) or a 7 (for a 6x6 puzzle) followed by a comma (,). The extra top line and left column are needed to insert information.
The content of each cell is then described and followed by a comma, going left to right and starting with the top line.
X = Gray cell, not required to be filled by a digit.
O (upper case letter)= White empty cell to be filled by a digit.
A = Or any one of the upper case letters from A to J to be replaced by its equivalent digit in the solved puzzle.
( ) = Location of the encrypted sums. Horizontal sums are preceded by a lower case "h" and vertical sums are preceded by a lower case "v". Those are followed by one or two upper case letters depending if the sum is a single digit or double digit one. For double digit sums, the first letter would be for the "tens" and the second one for the "units". When the cell must contain information for both a horizontal and a vertical sum, the first one is always for the horizontal sum and the two are separated by a comma within the same set of brackets, ex.: (hFE,vD). Each set of brackets is also immediately followed by a comma.
The description of the last cell is followed by a Carriage Return/Line Feed (CRLF) instead of a comma.
The required answer to each puzzle is based on the value of each letter necessary to arrive at the solution and according to the alphabetical order. As indicated under the example puzzle, its answer would be 8426039571. At least 9 out of the 10 encrypting letters are always part of the problem description. When only 9 are given, the missing one must be assigned the remaining digit.
You are given that the sum of the answers for the first 10 puzzles in the file is 64414157580.

Title: Prime Connection
Problem 425
Question: 
Two positive numbers $A$ and $B$ are said to be connected (denoted by "$A \leftrightarrow B$") if one of these conditions holds:
(1) $A$ and $B$ have the same length and differ in exactly one digit; for example, $123 \leftrightarrow 173$.
(2) Adding one digit to the left of $A$ (or $B$) makes $B$ (or $A$); for example, $23 \leftrightarrow 223$ and $123 \leftrightarrow 23$.


We call a prime $P$ a $2$'s relative if there exists a chain of connected primes between $2$ and $P$ and no prime in the chain exceeds $P$.


For example, $127$ is a $2$'s relative. One of the possible chains is shown below:
$2 \leftrightarrow 3 \leftrightarrow 13 \leftrightarrow 113 \leftrightarrow 103 \leftrightarrow 107 \leftrightarrow 127$
However, $11$ and $103$ are not $2$'s relatives.


Let $F(N)$ be the sum of the primes $\leq N$ which are not $2$'s relatives.
We can verify that $F(10^3) = 431$ and $F(10^4) = 78728$.

Title: Box-Ball System
Problem 426
Question: 
Consider an infinite row of boxes. Some of the boxes contain a ball. For example, an initial configuration of 2 consecutive occupied boxes followed by 2 empty boxes, 2 occupied boxes, 1 empty box, and 2 occupied boxes can be denoted by the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2), in which the number of consecutive occupied and empty boxes appear alternately.


A turn consists of moving each ball exactly once according to the following rule: Transfer the leftmost ball which has not been moved to the nearest empty box to its right.


After one turn the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2) becomes (2, 2, 1, 2, 3) as can be seen below; note that we begin the new sequence starting at the first occupied box.


A system like this is called a Box-Ball System or BBS for short.


It can be shown that after a sufficient number of turns, the system evolves to a state where the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes is invariant. In the example below, the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes evolves to [1, 2, 3]; we shall call this the final state.


We define the sequence {ti}:

Starting from the initial configuration (t0, t1, …, t10), the final state becomes [1, 3, 10, 24, 51, 75].
Starting from the initial configuration (t0, t1, …, t10 000 000), find the final state.
Give as your answer the sum of the squares of the elements of the final state. For example, if the final state is [1, 2, 3] then 14 ( = 12 + 22 + 32) is your answer.

Title: $n$-sequences
Problem 427
Question: A sequence of integers $S = \{s_i\}$ is called an $n$-sequence if it has $n$ elements and each element $s_i$ satisfies $1 \leq s_i \leq n$. Thus there are $n^n$ distinct $n$-sequences in total.
For example, the sequence $S = \{1, 5, 5, 10, 7, 7, 7, 2, 3, 7\}$ is a $10$-sequence.
For any sequence $S$, let $L(S)$ be the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of $S$ with the same value.
For example, for the given sequence $S$ above, $L(S) = 3$, because of the three consecutive $7$'s.
Let $f(n) = \sum L(S)$ for all $n$-sequences S.
For example, $f(3) = 45$, $f(7) = 1403689$ and $f(11) = 481496895121$.
Find $f(7\,500\,000) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,009$.

For example, $(5, 5, 5)$ and $(4, 3, 21)$ are necklace triplets, while it can be shown that $(2, 2, 5)$ is not.



Let $T(n)$ be the number of necklace triplets $(a, b, c)$ such that $a$, $b$ and $c$ are positive integers, and $b \leq n$.
For example, $T(1) = 9$, $T(20) = 732$ and $T(3000) = 438106$.

All disks with an index from $A$ to $B$ (inclusive) are flipped.
The following example shows the case $N = 8$. At the first turn $A = 5$ and $B = 2$, and at the second turn $A = 4$ and $B = 6$.

Let $E(N, M)$ be the expected number of disks that show their white side after $M$ turns.
We can verify that $E(3, 1) = 10/9$, $E(3, 2) = 5/3$, $E(10, 4) \approx 5.157$ and $E(100, 10) \approx 51.893$.
Find $E(10^{10}, 4000)$.

Title: Square Space Silo
Problem 431
Question: Fred the farmer arranges to have a new storage silo installed on his farm and having an obsession for all things square he is absolutely devastated when he discovers that it is circular. Quentin, the representative from the company that installed the silo, explains that they only manufacture cylindrical silos, but he points out that it is resting on a square base. Fred is not amused and insists that it is removed from his property.
Quick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are delivered from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle made with the horizontal is called the angle of repose. For example if the angle of repose, $\alpha = 30$ degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder. In the case of this silo, which has a diameter of $6\mathrm m$, the amount of space wasted would be approximately $32.648388556\mathrm{m^3}$. However, if grain is delivered at a point on the top which has a horizontal distance of $x$ metres from the centre then a cone with a strangely curved and sloping base is formed. He shows Fred a picture.
We shall let the amount of space wasted in cubic metres be given by $V(x)$. If $x = 1.114785284$, which happens to have three squared decimal places, then the amount of space wasted, $V(1.114785284) \approx 36$. Given the range of possible solutions to this problem there is exactly one other option: $V(2.511167869) \approx 49$. It would be like knowing that the square is king of the silo, sitting in splendid glory on top of your grain.
Fred's eyes light up with delight at this elegant resolution, but on closer inspection of Quentin's drawings and calculations his happiness turns to despondency once more. Fred points out to Quentin that it's the radius of the silo that is $6$ metres, not the diameter, and the angle of repose for his grain is $40$ degrees. However, if Quentin can find a set of solutions for this particular silo then he will be more than happy to keep it.
If Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the farmer's appetite for all things square then determine the values of $x$ for all possible square space wastage options and calculate $\sum x$ correct to $9$ decimal places.

Title: Rigid Graphs
Problem 434
Question: Recall that a graph is a collection of vertices and edges connecting the vertices, and that two vertices connected by an edge are called adjacent.
Graphs can be embedded in Euclidean space by associating each vertex with a point in the Euclidean space.
A flexible graph is an embedding of a graph where it is possible to move one or more vertices continuously so that the distance between at least two nonadjacent vertices is altered while the distances between each pair of adjacent vertices is kept constant.
A rigid graph is an embedding of a graph which is not flexible.
Informally, a graph is rigid if by replacing the vertices with fully rotating hinges and the edges with rods that are unbending and inelastic, no parts of the graph can be moved independently from the rest of the graph.

The grid graphs embedded in the Euclidean plane are not rigid, as the following animation demonstrates:
However, one can make them rigid by adding diagonal edges to the cells. For example, for the $2\times 3$ grid graph, there are $19$ ways to make the graph rigid:
Note that for the purposes of this problem, we do not consider changing the orientation of a diagonal edge or adding both diagonal edges to a cell as a different way of making a grid graph rigid.

Let $R(m,n)$ be the number of ways to make the $m \times n$ grid graph rigid. 
E.g. $R(2,3) = 19$ and $R(5,5) = 23679901$.

Define $S(N)$ as $\sum R(i,j)$ for $1 \leq i, j \leq N$.
E.g. $S(5) = 25021721$.
Find $S(100)$, give your answer modulo $1000000033$.

Title: Unfair Wager
Problem 436
Question: Julie proposes the following wager to her sister Louise.
She suggests they play a game of chance to determine who will wash the dishes.
For this game, they shall use a generator of independent random numbers uniformly distributed between $0$ and $1$.
The game starts with $S = 0$.
The first player, Louise, adds to $S$ different random numbers from the generator until $S \gt 1$ and records her last random number '$x$'.
The second player, Julie, continues adding to $S$ different random numbers from the generator until $S \gt 2$ and records her last random number '$y$'.
The player with the highest number wins and the loser washes the dishes, i.e. if $y \gt x$ the second player wins.
For example, if the first player draws $0.62$ and $0.44$, the first player turn ends since $0.62+0.44 \gt 1$ and $x = 0.44$.
If the second players draws $0.1$, $0.27$ and $0.91$, the second player turn ends since $0.62+0.44+0.1+0.27+0.91 \gt 2$ and $y = 0.91$.
Since $y \gt x$, the second player wins.
Louise thinks about it for a second, and objects: "That's not fair".
What is the probability that the second player wins?
Give your answer rounded to $10$ places behind the decimal point in the form 0.abcdefghij.

Question: 
When we calculate $8^n$ modulo $11$ for $n=0$ to $9$ we get: $1, 8, 9, 6, 4, 10, 3, 2, 5, 7$.
As we see all possible values from $1$ to $10$ occur. So $8$ is a primitive root of $11$.
But there is more:
If we take a closer look we see:
$1+8=9$
$8+9=17 \equiv 6 \bmod 11$
$9+6=15 \equiv 4 \bmod 11$
$6+4=10$
$4+10=14 \equiv 3 \bmod 11$
$10+3=13 \equiv 2 \bmod 11$
$3+2=5$
$2+5=7$
$5+7=12 \equiv 1 \bmod 11$.

Title: The Roundtable Lottery
Problem 444
Question: A group of $p$ people decide to sit down at a round table and play a lottery-ticket trading game. Each person starts off with a randomly-assigned, unscratched lottery ticket. Each ticket, when scratched, reveals a whole-pound prize ranging anywhere from £1 to £$p$, with no two tickets alike. The goal of the game is for all of the players to maximize the winnings of the ticket they hold upon leaving the game.
An arbitrary person is chosen to be the first player. Going around the table, each player has only one of two options:
The game ends once all tickets have been scratched. All players still remaining at the table must leave with their currently-held tickets.
Assume that players will use the optimal strategy for maximizing the expected value of their ticket winnings.
Let $E(p)$ represent the expected number of players left at the table when the game ends in a game consisting of $p$ players.
E.g. $E(111) = 5.2912$ when rounded to 5 significant digits.
Let $S_1(N) = \sum \limits_{p = 1}^{N} {E(p)}$.
Let $S_k(N) = \sum \limits_{p = 1}^{N} {S_{k-1}(p)}$ for $k \gt 1$.
Find $S_{20}(10^{14})$ and write the answer in scientific notation rounded to 10 significant digits. Use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and exponent. For example, the answer for $S_3(100)$ would be 5.983679014e5.

Question: 
Consider the number $15$.
There are eight positive numbers less than $15$ which are coprime to $15$: $1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14$.
The modular inverses of these numbers modulo $15$ are: $1, 8, 4, 13, 2, 11, 7, 14$  
because
$1 \cdot 1 \bmod 15=1$
$2 \cdot 8=16 \bmod 15=1$
$4 \cdot 4=16 \bmod 15=1$
$7 \cdot 13=91 \bmod 15=1$
$11 \cdot 11=121 \bmod 15=1$
$14 \cdot 14=196 \bmod 15=1$

Let $I(n)$ be the largest positive number $m$ smaller than $n-1$ such that the modular inverse of $m$ modulo $n$ equals $m$ itself.
So $I(15)=11$.
Also $I(100)=51$ and $I(7)=1$.

Title: An Ant on the Move
Problem 460
Question: 
On the Euclidean plane, an ant travels from point $A(0, 1)$ to point $B(d, 1)$ for an integer $d$.


In each step, the ant at point $(x_0, y_0)$ chooses one of the lattice points $(x_1, y_1)$ which satisfy $x_1 \ge 0$ and $y_1 \ge 1$ and goes straight to $(x_1, y_1)$ at a constant velocity $v$. The value of $v$ depends on $y_0$ and $y_1$ as follows:


The left image is one of the possible paths for $d = 4$. First the ant goes from $A(0, 1)$ to $P_1(1, 3)$ at velocity $(3 - 1) / (\ln(3) - \ln(1)) \approx 1.8205$. Then the required time is $\sqrt 5 / 1.8205 \approx 1.2283$.
From $P_1(1, 3)$ to $P_2(3, 3)$ the ant travels at velocity $3$ so the required time is $2 / 3 \approx 0.6667$. From $P_2(3, 3)$ to $B(4, 1)$ the ant travels at velocity $(1 - 3) / (\ln(1) - \ln(3)) \approx 1.8205$ so the required time is $\sqrt 5 / 1.8205 \approx 1.2283$.
Thus the total required time is $1.2283 + 0.6667 + 1.2283 = 3.1233$.


The right image is another path. The total required time is calculated as $0.98026 + 1 + 0.98026 = 2.96052$. It can be shown that this is the quickest path for $d = 4$.



Let $F(d)$ be the total required time if the ant chooses the quickest path. For example, $F(4) \approx 2.960516287$.
We can verify that $F(10) \approx 4.668187834$ and $F(100) \approx 9.217221972$.


Find $F(10000)$. Give your answer rounded to nine decimal places.

In fact, it is the best approximation of $\pi$ of the form $f_n(a) + f_n(b) + f_n(c) + f_n(d)$ for $n=200$.
Let $g(n)=a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$ for $a, b, c, d$ that minimize the error: $|f_n(a) + f_n(b) + f_n(c) + f_n(d) - \pi|$

Title: Permutation of 3-smooth Numbers
Problem 462
Question: 
A $3$-smooth number is an integer which has no prime factor larger than $3$. For an integer $N$, we define $S(N)$ as the set of $3$-smooth numbers less than or equal to $N$. For example, $S(20) = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18 \}$.


We define $F(N)$ as the number of permutations of $S(N)$ in which each element comes after all of its proper divisors.


This is one of the possible permutations for $N = 20$.
- $1, 2, 4, 3, 9, 8, 16, 6, 18, 12.$
This is not a valid permutation because $12$ comes before its divisor $6$.
- $1, 2, 4, 3, 9, 8, \boldsymbol{12}, 16, \boldsymbol 6, 18$.


We can verify that $F(6) = 5$, $F(8) = 9$, $F(20) = 450$ and $F(1000) \approx 8.8521816557\mathrm e21$.
Find $F(10^{18})$. Give as your answer its scientific notation rounded to ten digits after the decimal point.
When giving your answer, use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and exponent. E.g. if the answer is $112\,233\,445\,566\,778\,899$ then the answer format would be 1.1223344557e17.

Title: Polar Polygons
Problem 465
Question: The kernel of a polygon is defined by the set of points from which the entire polygon's boundary is visible. We define a polar polygon as a polygon for which the origin is strictly contained inside its kernel.
For this problem, a polygon can have collinear consecutive vertices. However, a polygon still cannot have self-intersection and cannot have zero area.
For example, only the first of the following is a polar polygon (the kernels of the second, third, and fourth do not strictly contain the origin, and the fifth does not have a kernel at all):


Notice that the first polygon has three consecutive collinear vertices.
Let $P(n)$ be the number of polar polygons such that the vertices $(x, y)$ have integer coordinates whose absolute values are not greater than $n$.
Note that polygons should be counted as different if they have different set of edges, even if they enclose the same area. For example, the polygon with vertices $[(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0)]$ is distinct from the polygon with vertices $[(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0),(1,0)]$.
For example, $P(1) = 131$, $P(2) = 1648531$, $P(3) = 1099461296175$ and $P(343) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007 = 937293740$.

Title: Superinteger

Question: An integer $s$ is called a superinteger of another integer $n$ if the digits of $n$ form a subsequenceA subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. of the digits of $s$.
For example, $2718281828$ is a superinteger of $18828$, while $314159$ is not a superinteger of $151$.

Let $p(n)$ be the $n$th prime number, and let $c(n)$ be the $n$th composite number. For example, $p(1) = 2$, $p(10) = 29$, $c(1)$ = 4 and $c(10) = 18$.
$\{p(i) : i \ge 1\} = \{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, \dots\}$
$\{c(i) : i \ge 1\} = \{4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, \dots\}$
Let $P^D$ be the sequence of the digital roots of $\{p(i)\}$ ($C^D$ is defined similarly for $\{c(i)\}$):
$P^D = \{2, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 8, 1, 5, 2, \dots\}$
$C^D = \{4, 6, 8, 9, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, \dots\}$
Let $P_n$ be the integer formed by concatenating the first $n$ elements of $P^D$ ($C_n$ is defined similarly for $C^D$).
$P_{10} = 2357248152$
$C_{10} = 4689135679$
Let $f(n)$ be the smallest positive integer that is a common superinteger of $P_n$ and $C_n$. For example, $f(10) = 2357246891352679$, and $f(100) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007 = 771661825$.

Title: Super Ramvok
Problem 470
Question: Consider a single game of Ramvok:
Let $t$ represent the maximum number of turns the game lasts. If $t = 0$, then the game ends immediately. Otherwise, on each turn $i$, the player rolls a die. After rolling, if $i \lt t$ the player can either stop the game and receive a prize equal to the value of the current roll, or discard the roll and try again next turn. If $i = t$, then the roll cannot be discarded and the prize must be accepted. Before the game begins, $t$ is chosen by the player, who must then pay an up-front cost $ct$ for some constant $c$. For $c = 0$, $t$ can be chosen to be infinite (with an up-front cost of $0$). Let $R(d, c)$ be the expected profit (i.e. net gain) that the player receives from a single game of optimally-played Ramvok, given a fair $d$-sided die and cost constant $c$. For example, $R(4, 0.2) = 2.65$. Assume that the player has sufficient funds for paying any/all up-front costs.
Now consider a game of Super Ramvok:
In Super Ramvok, the game of Ramvok is played repeatedly, but with a slight modification. After each game, the die is altered. The alteration process is as follows: The die is rolled once, and if the resulting face has its pips visible, then that face is altered to be blank instead. If the face is already blank, then it is changed back to its original value. After the alteration is made, another game of Ramvok can begin (and during such a game, at each turn, the die is rolled until a face with a value on it appears). The player knows which faces are blank and which are not at all times. The game of Super Ramvok ends once all faces of the die are blank.
Let $S(d, c)$ be the expected profit that the player receives from an optimally-played game of Super Ramvok, given a fair $d$-sided die to start (with all sides visible), and cost constant $c$. For example, $S(6, 1) = 208.3$.
Let $F(n) = \sum_{4 \le d \le n} \sum_{0 \le c \le n} S(d, c)$.
Calculate $F(20)$, rounded to the nearest integer.

Title: Comfortable Distance II
Problem 472
Question: There are $N$ seats in a row. $N$ people come one after another to fill the seats according to the following rules:

Note that due to rule 1, some seats will surely be left unoccupied, and the maximum number of people that can be seated is less than $N$ (for $N \gt 1$).
Here are the possible seating arrangements for $N = 15$:


We see that if the first person chooses correctly, the $15$ seats can seat up to $7$ people.
We can also see that the first person has $9$ choices to maximize the number of people that may be seated.
Let $f(N)$ be the number of choices the first person has to maximize the number of occupants for $N$ seats in a row. Thus, $f(1) = 1$, $f(15) = 9$, $f(20) = 6$, and $f(500) = 16$.
Also, $\sum f(N) = 83$ for $1 \le N \le 20$ and  $\sum f(N) = 13343$ for $1 \le N \le 500$.

Title: Phigital Number Base
Problem 473
Question: 
Let $\varphi$ be the golden ratio: $\varphi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}.$
Remarkably it is possible to write every positive integer as a sum of powers of $\varphi$ even if we require that every power of $\varphi$ is used at most once in this sum.
Even then this representation is not unique.
We can make it unique by requiring that no powers with consecutive exponents are used and that the representation is finite.
E.g: 
$2=\varphi+\varphi^{-2}$ and $3=\varphi^{2}+\varphi^{-2}$


To represent this sum of powers of $\varphi$ we use a string of 0's and 1's with a point to indicate where the negative exponents start.
We call this the representation in the phigital numberbase.
So $1=1_{\varphi}$, $2=10.01_{\varphi}$, $3=100.01_{\varphi}$ and $14=100100.001001_{\varphi}$. 
The strings representing $1$, $2$ and $14$ in the phigital number base are palindromic, while the string representing $3$ is not. (the phigital point is not the middle character).


The sum of the positive integers not exceeding $1000$ whose phigital representation is palindromic is $4345$.


Find the sum of the positive integers not exceeding $10^{10}$ whose phigital representation is palindromic.

For the purposes of this problem, we cannot separate the individual components from a mixture. However, we can combine different amounts of different mixtures to form mixtures with new ratios.
For example, say we have three mixtures with ratios $(3 : 0 : 2)$, $(3: 6 : 11)$ and $(3 : 3 : 4)$. By mixing $10$ units of the first, $20$ units of the second and $30$ units of the third, we get a new mixture with ratio $(6 : 5 : 9)$, since:
$(10 \cdot \tfrac 3 5$ + $20 \cdot \tfrac 3 {20} + 30 \cdot \tfrac 3 {10} : 10 \cdot \tfrac 0 5 + 20 \cdot \tfrac 6 {20} + 30 \cdot \tfrac 3 {10} : 10 \cdot \tfrac 2 5 + 20 \cdot \tfrac {11} {20} + 30 \cdot \tfrac 4 {10})
= (18 : 15 : 27) = (6 : 5 : 9)$

However, with the same three mixtures, it is impossible to form the ratio $(3 : 2 : 1)$, since the amount of B is always less than the amount of C.
Let $n$ be a positive integer. Suppose that for every triple of integers $(a, b, c)$ with $0 \le a, b, c \le n$ and $\gcd(a, b, c) = 1$, we have a mixture with ratio $(a : b : c)$. Let $M(n)$ be the set of all such mixtures.
For example, $M(2)$ contains the $19$ mixtures with the following ratios:
Let $E(n)$ be the number of subsets of $M(n)$ which can produce the mixture with ratio $(1 : 1 : 1)$, i.e., the mixture with equal parts A, B and C.
We can verify that $E(1) = 103$, $E(2) = 520447$, $E(10) \bmod 11^8 = 82608406$ and $E(500) \bmod 11^8 = 13801403$.
Find $E(10\,000\,000) \bmod 11^8$.

Title: Roots on the Rise
Problem 479
Question: Let $a_k$, $b_k$, and $c_k$ represent the three solutions (real or complex numbers) to the equation
$\frac 1 x = (\frac k x)^2(k+x^2)-k x$.
For instance, for $k=5$, we see that $\{a_5, b_5, c_5 \}$ is approximately $\{5.727244, -0.363622+2.057397i, -0.363622-2.057397i\}$.
Let $\displaystyle S(n) = \sum_{p=1}^n\sum_{k=1}^n(a_k+b_k)^p(b_k+c_k)^p(c_k+a_k)^p$. 
Interestingly, $S(n)$ is always an integer. For example, $S(4) = 51160$.

Title: The Last Question
Problem 480
Question: Consider all the words which can be formed by selecting letters, in any order, from the phrase:

Suppose those with 15 letters or less are listed in alphabetical order and numbered sequentially starting at 1.
The list would include:
Define P(w) as the position of the word w.
Define W(p) as the word in position p.
We can see that P(w) and W(p) are inverses: P(W(p)) = p and W(P(w)) = w.
Examples:
Find W(P(legionary) + P(calorimeters) - P(annihilate) + P(orchestrated) - P(fluttering)).
Give your answer using lowercase characters (no punctuation or space).

Title: Chef Showdown
Problem 481
Question: A group of chefs (numbered #$1$, #$2$, etc) participate in a turn-based strategic cooking competition. On each chef's turn, he/she cooks up a dish to the best of his/her ability and gives it to a separate panel of judges for taste-testing. Let $S(k)$ represent chef #$k$'s skill level (which is publicly known). More specifically, $S(k)$ is the probability that chef #$k$'s dish will be assessed favorably by the judges (on any/all turns). If the dish receives a favorable rating, then the chef must choose one other chef to be eliminated from the competition. The last chef remaining in the competition is the winner.
The game always begins with chef #$1$, with the turn order iterating sequentially over the rest of the chefs still in play. Then the cycle repeats from the lowest-numbered chef. All chefs aim to optimize their chances of winning within the rules as stated, assuming that the other chefs behave in the same manner. In the event that a chef has more than one equally-optimal elimination choice, assume that the chosen chef is always the one with the next-closest turn.
Define $W_n(k)$ as the probability that chef #$k$ wins in a competition with $n$ chefs. If we have $S(1) = 0.25$, $S(2) = 0.5$, and $S(3) = 1$, then $W_3(1) = 0.29375$.
Going forward, we assign $S(k) = F_k/F_{n+1}$ over all $1 \le k \le n$, where $F_k$ is a Fibonacci number: $F_k = F_{k-1} + F_{k-2}$ with base cases $F_1 = F_2 = 1$. Then, for example, when considering a competition with $n = 7$ chefs, we have $W_7(1) = 0.08965042$, $W_7(2) = 0.20775702$, $W_7(3) = 0.15291406$, $W_7(4) = 0.14554098$, $W_7(5) = 0.15905291$, $W_7(6) = 0.10261412$, and $W_7(7) = 0.14247050$, rounded to $8$ decimal places each.
Let $E(n)$ represent the expected number of dishes cooked in a competition with $n$ chefs. For instance, $E(7) = 42.28176050$.
Find $E(14)$ rounded to $8$ decimal places.

Title: Repeated Permutation
Problem 483
Question: 
We define a permutation as an operation that rearranges the order of the elements $\{1, 2, 3, ..., n\}$.
There are $n!$ such permutations, one of which leaves the elements in their initial order.
For $n = 3$ we have $3! = 6$ permutations:


If we select one of these permutations, and we re-apply the same permutation repeatedly, we eventually restore the initial order.For a permutation $P_i$, let $f(P_i)$ be the number of steps required to restore the initial order by applying the permutation $P_i$ repeatedly.For $n = 3$, we obtain:

Let $g(n)$ be the average value of $f^2(P_i)$ over all permutations $P_i$ of length $n$.$g(3) = (1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 3^2)/3! = 31/6 \approx 5.166666667\mathrm e0$$g(5) = 2081/120 \approx 1.734166667\mathrm e1$$g(20) = 12422728886023769167301/2432902008176640000 \approx 5.106136147\mathrm e3$


Find $g(350)$ and write the answer in scientific notation rounded to $10$ significant digits, using a lowercase e to separate mantissa and exponent, as in the examples above.

Title: Unbalanced Nim
Problem 488
Question: Alice and Bob have enjoyed playing Nim every day. However, they finally got bored of playing ordinary three-heap Nim.
So, they added an extra rule:
- Must not make two heaps of the same size.
The triple $(a, b, c)$ indicates the size of three heaps.
Under this extra rule, $(2,4,5)$ is one of the losing positions for the next player.
To illustrate:
- Alice moves to $(2,4,3)$
- Bob   moves to $(0,4,3)$
- Alice moves to $(0,2,3)$
- Bob   moves to $(0,2,1)$
Unlike ordinary three-heap Nim, $(0,1,2)$ and its permutations are the end states of this game.
For an integer $N$, we define $F(N)$ as the sum of $a + b + c$ for all the losing positions for the next player, with $0 \lt a \lt b \lt c \lt N$.
For example, $F(8) = 42$, because there are $4$ losing positions for the next player, $(1,3,5)$, $(1,4,6)$, $(2,3,6)$ and $(2,4,5)$.
We can also verify that $F(128) = 496062$.

Title: Jumping Frog
Problem 490
Question: There are $n$ stones in a pond, numbered $1$ to $n$. Consecutive stones are spaced one unit apart.
A frog sits on stone $1$. He wishes to visit each stone exactly once, stopping on stone $n$. However, he can only jump from one stone to another if they are at most $3$ units apart. In other words, from stone $i$, he can reach a stone $j$ if $1 \le j \le n$ and $j$ is in the set $\{i-3, i-2, i-1, i+1, i+2, i+3\}$.
Let $f(n)$ be the number of ways he can do this. For example, $f(6) = 14$, as shown below:
$1 \to 2 \to 3 \to 4 \to 5 \to 6$ 
$1 \to 2 \to 3 \to 5 \to 4 \to 6$ 
$1 \to 2 \to 4 \to 3 \to 5 \to 6$

$1 \to 3 \to 4 \to 2 \to 5 \to 6$ 
$1 \to 3 \to 5 \to 2 \to 4 \to 6$ 
$1 \to 4 \to 2 \to 3 \to 5 \to 6$ 
$1 \to 4 \to 2 \to 5 \to 3 \to 6$

Title: Collatz Prefix Families
Problem 494
Question: 
The Collatz sequence is defined as:
$a_{i+1} = \left\{  \large{\frac {a_i} 2 \atop 3 a_i+1} {\text{if }a_i\text{ is even} \atop \text{if }a_i\text{ is odd}} \right.$.


The Collatz conjecture states that starting from any positive integer, the sequence eventually reaches the cycle $1,4,2,1, \dots$.
We shall define the sequence prefix $p(n)$ for the Collatz sequence starting with $a_1 = n$ as the sub-sequence of all numbers not a power of $2$ ($2^0=1$ is considered a power of $2$ for this problem). For example:$p(13) = \{13, 40, 20, 10, 5\}$ $p(8) = \{\}$
Any number invalidating the conjecture would have an infinite length sequence prefix.


Let $S_m$ be the set of all sequence prefixes of length $m$. Two sequences $\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_m\}$ and $\{b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m\}$ in $S_m$ are said to belong to the same prefix family if $a_i \lt a_j$ if and only if $b_i \lt b_j$ for all $1 \le i,j \le m$.


For example, in $S_4$, $\{6, 3, 10, 5\}$ is in the same family as $\{454, 227, 682, 341\}$, but not $\{113, 340, 170, 85\}$.
Let $f(m)$ be the number of distinct prefix families in $S_m$.
You are given $f(5) = 5$, $f(10) = 55$, $f(20) = 6771$.


Find $f(90)$.

Title: Drunken Tower of Hanoi
Problem 497
Question: Bob is very familiar with the famous mathematical puzzle/game, "Tower of Hanoi," which consists of three upright rods and disks of different sizes that can slide onto any of the rods. The game begins with a stack of $n$ disks placed on the leftmost rod in descending order by size. The objective of the game is to move all of the disks from the leftmost rod to the rightmost rod, given the following restrictions:
Moving on to a variant of this game, consider a long room $k$ units (square tiles) wide, labeled from $1$ to $k$ in ascending order. Three rods are placed at squares $a$, $b$, and $c$, and a stack of $n$ disks is placed on the rod at square $a$.
Bob begins the game standing at square $b$. His objective is to play the Tower of Hanoi game by moving all of the disks to the rod at square $c$. However, Bob can only pick up or set down a disk if he is on the same square as the rod/stack in question.
Unfortunately, Bob is also drunk. On a given move, Bob will either stumble one square to the left or one square to the right with equal probability, unless Bob is at either end of the room, in which case he can only move in one direction. Despite Bob's inebriated state, he is still capable of following the rules of the game itself, as well as choosing when to pick up or put down a disk.
The following animation depicts a side-view of a sample game for $n = 3$, $k = 7$, $a = 2$, $b = 4$, and $c = 6$:

Let $E(n, k, a, b, c)$ be the expected number of squares that Bob travels during a single optimally-played game. A game is played optimally if the number of disk-pickups is minimized.
Interestingly enough, the result is always an integer. For example, $E(2,5,1,3,5) = 60$ and $E(3,20,4,9,17) = 2358$.
Find the last nine digits of $\sum_{1\le n \le 10000} E(n,10^n,3^n,6^n,9^n)$.

Title: St. Petersburg Lottery
Problem 499
Question: A gambler decides to participate in a special lottery. In this lottery the gambler plays a series of one or more games.
Each game costs $m$ pounds to play and starts with an initial pot of $1$ pound. The gambler flips an unbiased coin. Every time a head appears, the pot is doubled and the gambler continues. When a tail appears, the game ends and the gambler collects the current value of the pot. The gambler is certain to win at least $1$ pound, the starting value of the pot, at the cost of $m$ pounds, the initial fee.
The game ends if the gambler's fortune falls below $m$ pounds.
Let $p_m(s)$ denote the probability that the gambler will never run out of money in this lottery given an initial fortune $s$ and the cost per game $m$.
For example $p_2(2) \approx 0.2522$, $p_2(5) \approx 0.6873$ and $p_6(10\,000) \approx 0.9952$ (note: $p_m(s) = 0$ for $s \lt m$).

Title: Counting Castles
Problem 502
Question: We define a block to be a rectangle with a height of $1$ and an integer-valued length. Let a castle be a configuration of stacked blocks.
Given a game grid that is $w$ units wide and $h$ units tall, a castle is generated according to the following rules:
The following is a sample castle for $w=8$ and $h=5$:

Let $F(w,h)$ represent the number of valid castles, given grid parameters $w$ and $h$.
For example, $F(4,2) = 10$, $F(13,10) = 3729050610636$, $F(10,13) = 37959702514$, and $F(100,100) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007 = 841913936$.

Title: Compromise or Persist
Problem 503
Question: Alice is playing a game with $n$ cards numbered $1$ to $n$.
A game consists of iterations of the following steps.
(1) Alice picks one of the cards at random.
(2) Alice cannot see the number on it. Instead, Bob, one of her friends, sees the number and tells Alice how many previously-seen numbers are bigger than the number which he is seeing.
(3) Alice can end or continue the game. If she decides to end, the number becomes her score. If she decides to continue, the card is removed from the game and she returns to (1). If there is no card left, she is forced to end the game.
Let $F(n)$ be Alice's expected score if she takes the optimized strategy to minimize her score.
For example, $F(3) = 5/3$. At the first iteration, she should continue the game. At the second iteration, she should end the game if Bob says that one previously-seen number is bigger than the number which he is seeing, otherwise she should continue the game.
We can also verify that $F(4) = 15/8$ and $F(10) \approx 2.5579365079$.
Find $F(10^6)$. Give your answer rounded to $10$ decimal places behind the decimal point.

Title: Integers in Base $i-1$
Problem 508
Question: Consider the Gaussian integer $i-1$. A base $i-1$ representation of a Gaussian integer $a+bi$ is a finite sequence of digits $d_{n - 1}d_{n - 2}\cdots d_1 d_0$ such that:
Here are base $i-1$ representations of a few Gaussian integers:
$11+24i \to 111010110001101$
$24-11i \to 110010110011$
$8+0i \to 111000000$
$-5+0i \to 11001101$
$0+0i \to 0$

Remarkably, every Gaussian integer has a unique base $i-1$ representation!

Define $f(a + bi)$ as the number of $1$s in the unique base $i-1$ representation of $a + bi$. For example, $f(11+24i) = 9$ and $f(24-11i) = 7$.

Define $B(L)$ as the sum of $f(a + bi)$ for all integers $a, b$ such that $|a| \le L$ and $|b| \le L$. For example, $B(500) = 10795060$.

Title: Divisor Nim
Problem 509
Question: 
Anton and Bertrand love to play three pile Nim.
However, after a lot of games of Nim they got bored and changed the rules somewhat.
They may only take a number of stones from a pile that is a proper divisora proper divisor of $n$ is a divisor of $n$ smaller than $n$ of the number of stones present in the pile. E.g. if a pile at a certain moment contains $24$ stones they may take only $1,2,3,4,6,8$ or $12$ stones from that pile.
So if a pile contains one stone they can't take the last stone from it as $1$ isn't a proper divisor of $1$.
The first player that can't make a valid move loses the game.
Of course both Anton and Bertrand play optimally.

The triple $(a, b, c)$ indicates the number of stones in the three piles.
Let $S(n)$ be the number of winning positions for the next player for $1 \le a, b, c \le n$.$S(10) = 692$ and $S(100) = 735494$.

Title: Geoboard Shapes
Problem 514
Question: A geoboard (of order $N$) is a square board with equally-spaced pins protruding from the surface, representing an integer point lattice for coordinates $0 \le x, y \le N$.
John begins with a pinless geoboard. Each position on the board is a hole that can be filled with a pin. John decides to generate a random integer between $1$ and $N+1$ (inclusive) for each hole in the geoboard. If the random integer is equal to $1$ for a given hole, then a pin is placed in that hole.
After John is finished generating numbers for all $(N+1)^2$ holes and placing any/all corresponding pins, he wraps a tight rubberband around the entire group of pins protruding from the board. Let $S$ represent the shape that is formed. $S$ can also be defined as the smallest convex shape that contains all the pins.
The above image depicts a sample layout for $N = 4$. The green markers indicate positions where pins have been placed, and the blue lines collectively represent the rubberband. For this particular arrangement, $S$ has an area of $6$. If there are fewer than three pins on the board (or if all pins are collinear), $S$ can be assumed to have zero area.
Let $E(N)$ be the expected area of $S$ given a geoboard of order $N$. For example, $E(1) = 0.18750$, $E(2) = 0.94335$, and $E(10) = 55.03013$ when rounded to five decimal places each.

Title: Hilbert's Blackout
Problem 522
Question: Despite the popularity of Hilbert's infinite hotel, Hilbert decided to try managing extremely large finite hotels, instead.
To cut costs, Hilbert wished to power the new hotel with his own special generator. Each floor would send power to the floor above it, with the top floor sending power back down to the bottom floor. That way, Hilbert could have the generator placed on any given floor (as he likes having the option) and have electricity flow freely throughout the entire hotel.
Unfortunately, the contractors misinterpreted the schematics when they built the hotel. They informed Hilbert that each floor sends power to another floor at random, instead. This may compromise Hilbert's freedom to have the generator placed anywhere, since blackouts could occur on certain floors.
For example, consider a sample flow diagram for a three-story hotel:

If the generator were placed on the first floor, then every floor would receive power. But if it were placed on the second or third floors instead, then there would be a blackout on the first floor. Note that while a given floor can receive power from many other floors at once, it can only send power to one other floor.
To resolve the blackout concerns, Hilbert decided to have a minimal number of floors rewired. To rewire a floor is to change the floor it sends power to. In the sample diagram above, all possible blackouts can be avoided by rewiring the second floor to send power to the first floor instead of the third floor.
Let $F(n)$ be the sum of the minimum number of floor rewirings needed over all possible power-flow arrangements in a hotel of $n$ floors. For example, $F(3) = 6$, $F(8) = 16276736$, and $F(100) \bmod 135707531 = 84326147$.
Find $F(12344321) \bmod 135707531$.

The goal is to guess the value of $t$ by making repeated guesses, via integer $g$. After a guess is made, there are three possible outcomes, in which it will be revealed that either $g \lt t$, $g = t$, or $g \gt t$. Then the process can repeat as necessary.
Normally, the number of guesses required on average can be minimized with a binary search: Given a lower bound $L$ and upper bound $H$ (initialized to $L = 1$ and $H = n$), let $g = \lfloor(L+H)/2\rfloor$ where $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ is the integer floor function. If $g = t$, the process ends. Otherwise, if $g \lt t$, set $L = g+1$, but if $g \gt t$ instead, set $H = g - 1$. After setting the new bounds, the search process repeats, and ultimately ends once $t$ is found. Even if $t$ can be deduced without searching, assume that a search will be required anyway to confirm the value.
Your friend Bob believes that the standard binary search is not that much better than his randomized variant: Instead of setting $g = \lfloor(L+H)/2\rfloor$, simply let $g$ be a random integer between $L$ and $H$, inclusive. The rest of the algorithm is the same as the standard binary search. This new search routine will be referred to as a random binary search.
Given that $1 \le t \le n$ for random $t$, let $B(n)$ be the expected number of guesses needed to find $t$ using the standard binary search, and let $R(n)$ be the expected number of guesses needed to find $t$ using the random binary search. For example, $B(6) = 2.33333333$ and $R(6) = 2.71666667$ when rounded to $8$ decimal places.
Find $R(10^{10}) - B(10^{10})$ rounded to $8$ decimal places.

Title: Nanobots on Geodesics
Problem 532
Question: Bob is a manufacturer of nanobots and wants to impress his customers by giving them a ball coloured by his new nanobots as a present.
His nanobots can be programmed to select and locate exactly one other bot precisely and, after activation, move towards this bot along the shortest possible path and draw a coloured line onto the surface while moving. Placed on a plane, the bots will start to move towards their selected bots in a straight line. In contrast, being placed on a ball, they will start to move along a geodesic as the shortest possible path. However, in both cases, whenever their target moves they will adjust their direction instantaneously to the new shortest possible path. All bots will move at the same speed after their simultaneous activation until each bot reaches its goal.
Now Bob places $n$ bots on the ball (with radius $1$) equidistantly on a small circle with radius $0.999$ and programs each of them to move toward the next nanobot sitting counterclockwise on that small circle. After activation, the bots move in a sort of spiral until they finally meet at one point on the ball.
Using three bots, Bob finds that every bot will draw a line of length $2.84$, resulting in a total length of $8.52$ for all three bots, each time rounded to two decimal places. The coloured ball looks like this:
In order to show off a little with his presents, Bob decides to use just enough bots to make sure that the line each bot draws is longer than $1000$. What is the total length of all lines drawn with this number of bots, rounded to two decimal places?

Title: Weak Queens
Problem 534
Question: The classical eight queens puzzle is the well known problem of placing eight chess queens on an $8 \times 8$ chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Allowing configurations to reappear in rotated or mirrored form, a total of $92$ distinct configurations can be found for eight queens. The general case asks for the number of distinct ways of placing $n$ queens on an $n \times n$ board, e.g. you can find $2$ distinct configurations for $n=4$.
Let's define a weak queen on an $n \times n$ board to be a piece which can move any number of squares if moved horizontally, but a maximum of $n - 1 - w$ squares if moved vertically or diagonally, $0 \le w \lt n$ being the "weakness factor". For example, a weak queen on an $n \times n$ board with a weakness factor of $w=1$ located in the bottom row will not be able to threaten any square in the top row as the weak queen would need to move $n - 1$ squares vertically or diagonally to get there, but may only move $n - 2$ squares in these directions. In contrast, the weak queen is not handicapped horizontally, thus threatening every square in its own row, independently from its current position in that row.
Let $Q(n,w)$ be the number of ways $n$ weak queens with weakness factor $w$ can be placed on an $n \times n$ board so that no two queens threaten each other. It can be shown, for example, that $Q(4,0)=2$, $Q(4,2)=16$ and $Q(4,3)=256$.
Let $S(n)=\displaystyle\sum_{w=0}^{n-1} Q(n,w)$.
You are given that $S(4)=276$ and $S(5)=3347$.
Find $S(14)$.

Title: Maximum Quadrilaterals
Problem 538
Question: Consider a positive integer sequence $S = (s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n)$.
Let $f(S)$ be the perimeter of the maximum-area quadrilateral whose side lengths are $4$ elements $(s_i, s_j, s_k, s_l)$ of $S$ (all $i, j, k, l$ distinct). If there are many quadrilaterals with the same maximum area, then choose the one with the largest perimeter.
For example, if $S = (8, 9, 14, 9, 27)$, then we can take the elements $(9, 14, 9, 27)$ and form an isosceles trapeziumAn isosceles trapezium (US: trapezoid) is a quadrilateral where one pair of opposite sides are parallel and of different lengths, and the other pair has the same length. with parallel side lengths $14$ and $27$ and both leg lengths $9$. The area of this quadrilateral is $127.611470879\cdots$ It can be shown that this is the largest area for any quadrilateral that can be formed using side lengths from $S$. Therefore, $f(S) = 9 + 14 + 9 + 27 = 59$.
Let $u_n = 2^{B(3n)} + 3^{B(2n)} + B(n + 1)$, where $B(k)$ is the number of $1$ bits of $k$ in base $2$.
For example, $B(6) = 2$, $B(10) = 2$ and $B(15) = 4$, and $u_5 = 2^4 + 3^2 + 2 = 27$.
Also, let $U_n$ be the sequence $(u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n)$.
For example, $U_{10} = (8, 9, 14, 9, 27, 16, 36, 9, 27, 28)$.
It can be shown that $f(U_5) = 59$, $f(U_{10}) = 118$, $f(U_{150}) = 3223$.
It can also be shown that $\sum f(U_n) = 234761$ for $4 \le n \le 150$.
Find $\sum f(U_n)$ for $4 \le n \le 3\,000\,000$.

Title: Distance of Random Points Within Hollow Square Laminae
Problem 547
Question: Assuming that two points are chosen randomly (with uniform distribution) within a rectangle, it is possible to determine the expected value of the distance between these two points.
For example, the expected distance between two random points in a unit square is about $0.521405$, while the expected distance between two random points in a rectangle with side lengths $2$ and $3$ is about $1.317067$.
Now we define a hollow square lamina of size $n$ to be an integer sized square with side length $n \ge 3$ consisting of $n^2$ unit squares from which a rectangle consisting of $x \times y$ unit squares ($1 \le x,y \le n - 2$) within the original square has been removed.
For $n = 3$ there exists only one hollow square lamina:

For $n = 4$ you can find $9$ distinct hollow square laminae, allowing shapes to reappear in rotated or mirrored form:

Let $S(n)$ be the sum of the expected distance between two points chosen randomly within each of the possible hollow square laminae of size $n$. The two points have to lie within the area left after removing the inner rectangle, i.e. the gray-colored areas in the illustrations above.
For example, $S(3) = 1.6514$ and $S(4) = 19.6564$, rounded to four digits after the decimal point.

Title: Chinese Leftovers II
Problem 552
Question: 
Let $A_n$ be the smallest positive integer satisfying $A_n \bmod p_i = i$ for all $1 \le i \le n$, where $p_i$ is the
$i$-th prime.
For example $A_2 = 5$, since this is the smallest positive solution of the system of equations

The system of equations for $A_3$ adds another constraint. That is, $A_3$ is the smallest positive solution of

and hence $A_3 = 23$. Similarly, one gets $A_4 = 53$ and $A_5 = 1523$.


Let $S(n)$ be the sum of all primes up to $n$ that divide at least one element in the sequence $A$.
For example, $S(50) = 69 = 5 + 23 + 41$, since $5$ divides $A_2$, $23$ divides $A_3$ and $41$ divides $A_{10} = 5765999453$. No other prime number up to $50$ divides an element in $A$.

Title: Power Sets of Power Sets
Problem 553
Question: Let $P(n)$ be the set of the first $n$ positive integers $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$.
Let $Q(n)$ be the set of all the non-empty subsets of $P(n)$.
Let $R(n)$ be the set of all the non-empty subsets of $Q(n)$.
An element $X \in R(n)$ is a non-empty subset of $Q(n)$, so it is itself a set.
From $X$ we can construct a graph as follows:
For example, $X = \{\{1\},\{1,2,3\},\{3\},\{5,6\},\{6,7\}\}$ results in the following graph:
This graph has two connected components.
Let $C(n, k)$ be the number of elements of $R(n)$ that have exactly $k$ connected components in their graph.

Title: Centaurs on a Chess Board
Problem 554
Question: On a chess board, a centaur moves like a king or a knight. The diagram below shows the valid moves of a centaur (represented by an inverted king) on an $8 \times 8$ board.
It can be shown that at most $n^2$ non-attacking centaurs can be placed on a board of size $2n \times 2n$.
Let $C(n)$ be the number of ways to place $n^2$ centaurs on a $2n \times 2n$ board so that no centaur attacks another directly.
For example $C(1) = 4$, $C(2) = 25$, $C(10) = 1477721$.
Let $F_i$ be the $i$th Fibonacci number defined as $F_1 = F_2 = 1$ and $F_i = F_{i - 1} + F_{i - 2}$ for $i \gt 2$.

Title: McCarthy 91 Function
Problem 555
Question: 
The McCarthy 91 function is defined as follows:
$$
M_{91}(n) = 
    \begin{cases}
        n - 10 & \text{if } n > 100 \\
        M_{91}(M_{91}(n+11)) & \text{if } 0 \leq n \leq 100
    \end{cases}
$$


We can generalize this definition by abstracting away the constants into new variables:

$$
M_{m,k,s}(n) = 
    \begin{cases}
        n - s & \text{if } n > m \\
        M_{m,k,s}(M_{m,k,s}(n+k)) & \text{if } 0 \leq n \leq m
    \end{cases}
$$


This way, we have $M_{91} = M_{100,11,10}$.


Let $F_{m,k,s}$ be the set of fixed points of $M_{m,k,s}$. That is, 

$$F_{m,k,s}= \left\{ n \in \mathbb{N} \, | \, M_{m,k,s}(n) = n \right\}$$


For example, the only fixed point of $M_{91}$ is $n = 91$. In other words, $F_{100,11,10}= \{91\}$.


Now, define $SF(m,k,s)$ as the sum of the elements in $F_{m,k,s}$ and let $S(p,m) = \displaystyle \sum_{1 \leq s < k \leq p}{SF(m,k,s)}$.


For example, $S(10, 10) = 225$ and $S(1000, 1000)=208724467$.


Find $S(10^6, 10^6)$.

Title: Squarefree Gaussian Integers
Problem 556
Question: A Gaussian integer is a number $z = a + bi$ where $a$, $b$ are integers and $i^2 = -1$.
Gaussian integers are a subset of the complex numbers, and the integers are the subset of Gaussian integers for which $b = 0$.
A Gaussian integer unit is one for which $a^2 + b^2 = 1$, i.e. one of $1, i, -1, -i$.
Let's define a proper Gaussian integer as one for which $a \gt 0$ and $b \ge 0$.
A Gaussian integer $z_1 = a_1 + b_1 i$ is said to be divisible by $z_2 = a_2 + b_2 i$ if $z_3 = a_3 + b_3 i = z_1 / z_2$ is a Gaussian integer.
$\frac {z_1} {z_2} = \frac {a_1 + b_1 i} {a_2 + b_2 i} = \frac {(a_1 + b_1 i)(a_2 - b_2 i)} {(a_2 + b_2 i)(a_2 - b_2 i)} = \frac {a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2} + \frac  {a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2}  {a_2^2 + b_2^2}i = a_3 + b_3 i$
So, $z_1$ is divisible by $z_2$ if $\frac {a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2}$ and $\frac  {a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2}  {a_2^2 + b_2^2}$ are integers.
For example, $2$ is divisible by $1 + i$ because $2/(1 + i) = 1 - i$ is a Gaussian integer.
A Gaussian prime is a Gaussian integer that is divisible only by a unit, itself or itself times a unit.
For example, $1 + 2i$ is a Gaussian prime, because it is only divisible by $1$, $i$, $-1$, $-i$, $1 + 2i$, $i(1 + 2i) = i - 2$, $-(1 + 2i) = -1 - 2i$ and $-i(1 + 2i) = 2 - i$.
$2$ is not a Gaussian prime as it is divisible by $1 + i$.
A Gaussian integer can be uniquely factored as the product of a unit and proper Gaussian primes.
For example $2 = -i(1 + i)^2$ and $1 + 3i = (1 + i)(2 + i)$.
A Gaussian integer is said to be squarefree if its prime factorization does not contain repeated proper Gaussian primes.
So $2$ is not squarefree over the Gaussian integers, but $1 + 3i$ is.
Units and Gaussian primes are squarefree by definition.
Let $f(n)$ be the count of proper squarefree Gaussian integers with $a^2 + b^2 \le n$.
For example $f(10) = 7$ because $1$, $1 + i$, $1 + 2i$, $1 + 3i = (1 + i)(1 + 2i)$, $2 + i$, $3$ and $3 + i = -i(1 + i)(1 + 2i)$ are squarefree, while $2 = -i(1 + i)^2$ and $2 + 2i = -i(1 + i)^3$ are not.
You are given $f(10^2) = 54$, $f(10^4) = 5218$ and $f(10^8) = 52126906$.
Find $f(10^{14})$.

Title: Cutting Triangles
Problem 557
Question: 
A triangle is cut into four pieces by two straight lines, each starting at one vertex and ending on the opposite edge. This results in forming three smaller triangular pieces, and one quadrilateral.  If the original triangle has an integral area, it is often possible to choose cuts such that all of the four pieces also have integral area.  For example, the diagram below shows a triangle of area $55$ that has been cut in this way.


Representing the areas as $a, b, c$ and $d$, in the example above, the individual areas are $a = 22$, $b = 8$, $c = 11$ and $d = 14$.  It is also possible to cut a triangle of area $55$ such that $a = 20$, $b = 2$, $c = 24$, $d = 9$.

Define a triangle cutting quadruple $(a, b, c, d)$ as a valid integral division of a triangle, where $a$ is the area of the triangle between the two cut vertices, $d$ is the area of the quadrilateral and $b$ and $c$ are the areas of the two other triangles, with the restriction that $b \le c$.  The two solutions described above are $(22,8,11,14)$ and $(20,2,24,9)$.  These are the only two possible quadruples that have a total area of $55$.


Define $S(n)$ as the sum of the area of the uncut triangles represented by all valid quadruples with $a+b+c+d \le n$. For example, $S(20) = 259$.  


Find $S(10000)$.

Title: Irrational Base
Problem 558
Question: Let $r$ be the real root of the equation $x^3 = x^2 + 1$.
Every positive integer can be written as the sum of distinct increasing powers of $r$.
If we require the number of terms to be finite and the difference between any two exponents to be three or more, then the representation is unique.
For example, $3 = r^{-10} + r^{-5} + r^{-1} + r^2$ and $10 = r^{-10} + r^{-7} + r^6$.
Interestingly, the relation holds for the complex roots of the equation.
Let $w(n)$ be the number of terms in this unique representation of $n$. Thus $w(3) = 4$ and $w(10) = 3$.
More formally, for all positive integers $n$, we have:
$n = \displaystyle \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty b_k r^k$
under the conditions that:
$b_k$ is $0$ or $1$ for all $k$;
$b_k + b_{k + 1} + b_{k + 2} \le 1$ for all $k$;
$w(n) = \displaystyle \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty b_k$ is finite.
Let $S(m) = \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^m w(j^2)$.
You are given $S(10) = 61$ and $S(1000) = 19403$.
Find $S(5\,000\,000)$.

Problem 560
Question: Coprime Nim is just like ordinary normal play Nim, but the players may only remove a number of stones from a pile that is coprime with the current size of the pile. Two players remove stones in turn. The player who removes the last stone wins.
Let $L(n, k)$ be the number of losing starting positions for the first player, assuming perfect play, when the game is played with $k$ piles, each having between $1$ and $n - 1$ stones inclusively.
For example, $L(5, 2) = 6$ since the losing initial positions are $(1, 1)$, $(2, 2)$, $(2, 4)$, $(3, 3)$, $(4, 2)$ and $(4, 4)$.
You are also given $L(10, 5) = 9964$, $L(10, 10) = 472400303$, $L(10^3, 10^3) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007 = 954021836$.

For $n=6$ we get the following pairs: $(1,2), (1,3), (1,6),( 2,6)$ and $(3,6)$. So $S(6)=5$.

Let $E(m, n)$ be the highest integer $k$ such that $2^k$ divides $S((p_m\#)^n)$.
$E(2,1) = 0$ since $2^0$ is the highest power of 2 that divides S(6)=5.

Title: Robot Welders
Problem 563
Question: A company specialises in producing large rectangular metal sheets, starting from unit square metal plates.  The welding is performed by a range of robots of increasing size.  Unfortunately, the programming options of these robots are rather limited.  Each one can only process up to $25$ identical rectangles of metal, which they can weld along either edge to produce a larger rectangle.  The only programmable variables are the number of rectangles to be processed (up to and including $25$), and whether to weld the long or short edge.
For example, the first robot could be programmed to weld together $11$ raw unit square plates to make a $11 \times 1$ strip. The next could take $10$ of these $11 \times 1$ strips, and weld them either to make a longer $110 \times 1$ strip, or a $11 \times 10$ rectangle. Many, but not all, possible dimensions of  metal sheets can be constructed in this way.
One regular customer has a particularly unusual order: The finished product should have an exact area, and the long side must not be more than $10\%$ larger than the short side. If these requirements can be met in more than one way, in terms of the exact dimensions of the two sides, then the customer will demand that all variants be produced. For example, if the order calls for a metal sheet of area $889200$, then there are three final dimensions that can be produced: $900 \times 988$, $912 \times 975$ and $936 \times 950$. The target area of $889200$ is the smallest area which can be manufactured in three different variants, within the limitations of the robot welders.
Let $M(n)$ be the minimal area that can be manufactured in exactly $n$ variants with the longer edge not greater than $10\%$ bigger than the shorter edge. Hence $M(3) = 889200$.
Find $\sum_{n=2}^{100} M(n)$.

Title: Maximal Polygons
Problem 564
Question: A line segment of length $2n-3$ is randomly split into $n$ segments of integer length ($n \ge 3$). In the sequence given by this split, the segments are then used as consecutive sides of a convex $n$-polygon, formed in such a way that its area is maximal.  All of the $\binom{2n-4} {n-1}$ possibilities for splitting up the initial line segment occur with the same probability. 
Let $E(n)$ be the expected value of the area that is obtained by this procedure.
For example, for $n=3$ the only possible split of the line segment of length $3$ results in three line segments with length $1$, that form an equilateral triangle with an area of $\frac 1 4 \sqrt{3}$. Therefore $E(3)=0.433013$, rounded to $6$ decimal places.
For $n=4$ you can find $4$ different possible splits, each of which is composed of three line segments with length $1$ and one line segment with length $2$. All of these splits lead to the same maximal quadrilateral with an area of $\frac 3 4 \sqrt{3}$, thus $E(4)=1.299038$, rounded to $6$ decimal places.
Let $S(k)=\displaystyle \sum_{n=3}^k E(n)$.
For example, $S(3)=0.433013$, $S(4)=1.732051$, $S(5)=4.604767$ and $S(10)=66.955511$, rounded to $6$ decimal places each.

Title: Cake Icing Puzzle
Problem 566
Question: Adam plays the following game with his birthday cake.
He cuts a piece forming a circular sector of $60$ degrees and flips the piece upside down, with the icing on the bottom.
He then rotates the cake by $60$ degrees counterclockwise, cuts an adjacent $60$ degree piece and flips it upside down.
He keeps repeating this, until after a total of twelve steps, all the icing is back on top.
Amazingly, this works for any piece size, even if the cutting angle is an irrational number: all the icing will be back on top after a finite number of steps.
Now, Adam tries something different: he alternates cutting pieces of size $x=\frac{360}{9}$ degrees, $y=\frac{360}{10}$ degrees and $z=\frac{360 }{\sqrt{11}}$ degrees. The first piece he cuts has size $x$ and he flips it. The second has size $y$ and he flips it. The third has size $z$ and he flips it. He repeats this with pieces of size $x$, $y$ and $z$ in that order until all the icing is back on top, and discovers he needs $60$ flips altogether.
Let $F(a, b, c)$ be the minimum number of piece flips needed to get all the icing back on top for pieces of size $x=\frac{360}{a}$ degrees, $y=\frac{360}{b}$ degrees and $z=\frac{360}{\sqrt{c}}$ degrees.
Let $G(n) = \sum_{9 \le a \lt b \lt c \le n} F(a,b,c)$, for integers $a$, $b$ and $c$.
You are given that $F(9, 10, 11) = 60$, $F(10, 14, 16) = 506$, $F(15, 16, 17) = 785232$.
You are also given $G(11) = 60$, $G(14) = 58020$ and $G(17) = 1269260$.

Title: Reciprocal Games I
Problem 567
Question: Tom has built a random generator that is connected to a row of $n$ light bulbs. Whenever the random generator is activated each of the $n$ lights is turned on with the probability of $\frac 1 2$, independently of its former state or the state of the other light bulbs.
While discussing with his friend Jerry how to use his generator, they invent two different games, they call the reciprocal games:
Both games consist of $n$ turns. Each turn is started by choosing a number $k$ randomly between (and including) $1$ and $n$, with equal probability of $\frac 1 n$ for each number, while the possible win for that turn is the reciprocal of $k$, that is $\frac 1 k$.
In game A, Tom activates his random generator once in each turn. If the number of lights turned on is the same as the previously chosen number $k$, Jerry wins and gets $\frac 1 k$, otherwise he will receive nothing for that turn. Jerry's expected win after playing the total game A consisting of $n$ turns is called $J_A(n)$. For example $J_A(6)=0.39505208$, rounded to $8$ decimal places.
For each turn in game B, after $k$ has been randomly selected, Tom keeps reactivating his random generator until exactly $k$ lights are turned on. After that Jerry takes over and reactivates the random generator until he, too, has generated a pattern with exactly $k$ lights turned on. If this pattern is identical to Tom's last pattern, Jerry wins and gets $\frac 1 k$, otherwise he will receive nothing. Jerry's expected win after the total game B consisting of $n$ turns is called $J_B(n)$. For example $J_B(6)=0.43333333$, rounded to $8$ decimal places.
Let $\displaystyle S(m)=\sum_{n=1}^m (J_A(n)+J_B(n))$. For example $S(6)=7.58932292$, rounded to $8$ decimal places.

In the example above, the eye-line from the third mountain is drawn in red, showing that he can only see the peak of the second mountain from this viewpoint. Similarly, from the $9$th mountain, he can see three peaks, those of the $5$th, $7$th and $8$th mountain.
Let $P(k)$ be the number of peaks that are visible looking back from the $k$th mountain.  Hence $P(3)=1$ and $P(9)=3$.
Also $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{100} P(k) = 227$.
Find $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{2500000} P(k)$.

Title: Snowflakes
Problem 570
Question: A snowflake of order $n$ is formed by overlaying an equilateral triangle (rotated by $180$ degrees) onto each equilateral triangle of the same size in a snowflake of order $n-1$. A snowflake of order $1$ is a single equilateral triangle.
Some areas of the snowflake are overlaid repeatedly. In the above picture, blue represents the areas that are one layer thick, red two layers thick, yellow three layers thick, and so on.
For an order $n$ snowflake, let $A(n)$ be the number of triangles that are one layer thick, and let $B(n)$ be the number of triangles that are three layers thick. Define $G(n) = \gcd(A(n), B(n))$.
E.g. $A(3) = 30$, $B(3) = 6$, $G(3)=6$.
$A(11) = 3027630$, $B(11) = 19862070$, $G(11) = 30$.
Further, $G(500) = 186$ and $\sum_{n=3}^{500}G(n)=5124$.
Find $\displaystyle \sum_{n=3}^{10^7}G(n)$.

Title: Super Pandigital Numbers
Problem 571
Question: A positive number is pandigital in base $b$ if it contains all digits from $0$ to $b - 1$ at least once when written in base $b$.
An $n$-super-pandigital number is a number that is simultaneously pandigital in all bases from $2$ to $n$ inclusively.
For example $978 = 1111010010_2 = 1100020_3 = 33102_4 = 12403_5$ is the smallest $5$-super-pandigital number.
Similarly, $1093265784$ is the smallest $10$-super-pandigital number.
The sum of the $10$ smallest $10$-super-pandigital numbers is $20319792309$.
What is the sum of the $10$ smallest $12$-super-pandigital numbers?

Title: Unfair Race
Problem 573
Question: $n$ runners in very different training states want to compete in a race. Each one of them is given a different starting number $k$ $(1\leq k \leq n)$ according to the runner's (constant) individual racing speed being $v_k=\frac{k}{n}$.
In order to give the slower runners a chance to win the race, $n$ different starting positions are chosen randomly (with uniform distribution) and independently from each other within the racing track of length $1$. After this, the starting position nearest to the goal is assigned to runner $1$, the next nearest starting position to runner $2$ and so on, until finally the starting position furthest away from the goal is assigned to runner $n$. The winner of the race is the runner who reaches the goal first.
Interestingly, the expected running time for the winner is $\frac{1}{2}$, independently of the number of runners. Moreover, while it can be shown that all runners will have the same expected running time of $\frac{n}{n+1}$, the race is still unfair, since the winning chances may differ significantly for different starting numbers:
Let $P_{n,k}$ be the probability for runner $k$ to win a race with $n$ runners and $E_n = \sum_{k=1}^n k P_{n,k}$ be the expected starting number of the winner in that race. It can be shown that, for example,
$P_{3,1}=\frac{4}{9}$, $P_{3,2}=\frac{2}{9}$, $P_{3,3}=\frac{1}{3}$ and $E_3=\frac{17}{9}$ for a race with $3$ runners. 
You are given that $E_4=2.21875$, $E_5=2.5104$ and $E_{10}=3.66021568$.
Find $E_{1000000}$ rounded to $4$ digits after the decimal point.

Title: Verifying Primes
Problem 574
Question: Let $q$ be a prime and $A \ge B >0$ be two integers with the following properties:

It can be shown that, given these conditions, any sum $A+B<q^2$ and any difference $1<A-B<q^2$ has to be a prime number. Thus you can verify that a number $p$ is prime by showing that either $p=A+B<q^2$ or $p=A-B<q^2$ for some $A,B,q$ fulfilling the conditions listed above.
Let $V(p)$ be the smallest possible value of $A$ in any sum $p=A+B$ and any difference $p=A-B$, that verifies $p$ being prime. Examples:
$V(2)=1$, since $2=1+1< 2^2$. 
$V(37)=22$, since $37=22+15=2 \cdot 11+3 \cdot 5< 7^2$ is the associated sum with the smallest possible $A$.
$V(151)=165$ since $151=165-14=3 \cdot 5 \cdot 11 - 2 \cdot 7<13^2$ is the associated difference with the smallest possible $A$. 

Let $S(n)$ be the sum of $V(p)$ for all primes $p<n$. For example, $S(10)=10$ and $S(200)=7177$.

Find $S(3800)$.

Title: Wandering Robots
Problem 575
Question: It was quite an ordinary day when a mysterious alien vessel appeared as if from nowhere. After waiting several hours and receiving no response it is decided to send a team to investigate, of which you are included. Upon entering the vessel you are met by a friendly holographic figure, Katharina, who explains the purpose of the vessel, Eulertopia.
She claims that Eulertopia is almost older than time itself. Its mission was to take advantage of a combination of incredible computational power and vast periods of time to discover the answer to life, the universe, and everything. Hence the resident cleaning robot, Leonhard, along with his housekeeping responsibilities, was built with a powerful computational matrix to ponder the meaning of life as he wanders through a massive 1000 by 1000 square grid of rooms. She goes on to explain that the rooms are numbered sequentially from left to right, row by row. So, for example, if Leonhard was wandering around a 5 by 5 grid then the rooms would be numbered in the following way.
Many millenia ago Leonhard reported to Katharina to have found the answer and he is willing to share it with any life form who proves to be worthy of such knowledge.
Katharina further explains that the designers of Leonhard were given instructions to program him with equal probability of remaining in the same room or travelling to an adjacent room. However, it was not clear to them if this meant (i) an equal probability being split equally between remaining in the room and the number of available routes, or, (ii) an equal probability (50%) of remaining in the same room and then the other 50% was to be split equally between the number of available routes.
The records indicate that they decided to flip a coin. Heads would mean that the probability of remaining was dynamically related to the number of exits whereas tails would mean that they program Leonhard with a fixed 50% probability of remaining in a particular room. Unfortunately there is no record of the outcome of the coin, so without further information we would need to assume that there is equal probability of either of the choices being implemented.
Katharina suggests it should not be too challenging to determine that the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in a 5 by 5 grid after unfathomable periods of time would be approximately 0.177976190476 [12 d.p.].
In order to prove yourself worthy of visiting the great oracle you must calculate the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in the 1000 by 1000 lair in which he has been wandering.
(Give your answer rounded to 12 decimal places)

Title: Irrational Jumps
Problem 576
Question: 
A bouncing point moves counterclockwise along a circle with circumference $1$ with jumps of constant length $l \lt 1$, until it hits a gap of length $g \lt 1$, that is placed in a distance $d$ counterclockwise from the starting point. The gap does not include the starting point, that is $g+d \lt 1$.
Let $S(l,g,d)$ be the sum of the length of all jumps, until the point falls into the gap. It can be shown that $S(l,g,d)$ is finite for any irrational jump size $l$, regardless of the values of $g$ and $d$.
Examples: 
$S(\sqrt{\frac 1 2}, 0.06, 0.7)=0.7071 \cdots$, $S(\sqrt{\frac 1 2}, 0.06, 0.3543)=1.4142 \cdots$ and  $S(\sqrt{\frac 1 2}, 0.06, 0.2427)=16.2634 \cdots$.

Let $M(n, g)$ be the maximum of $ \sum S(\sqrt{\frac 1 p}, g, d)$ for all primes $p \le n$ and any valid value of $d$.
Examples:
$M(3, 0.06) =29.5425 \cdots$, since $S(\sqrt{\frac 1 2}, 0.06, 0.2427)+S(\sqrt{\frac 1 3}, 0.06, 0.2427)=29.5425 \cdots$ is the maximal reachable sum for $g=0.06$. 
$M(10, 0.01)=266.9010 \cdots$ 
Find $M(100, 0.00002)$, rounded to $4$ decimal places.

Title: Integers with Decreasing Prime Powers
Problem 578
Question: Any positive integer can be written as a product of prime powers: $p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \cdots \times p_k^{a_k}$,
where $p_i$ are distinct prime integers, $a_i \gt 0$ and $p_i \lt p_j$ if $i \lt j$.
A decreasing prime power positive integer is one for which $a_i \ge a_j$ if $i \lt j$.
For example, $1$, $2$, $15=3 \times 5$, $360=2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5$ and $1000=2^3 \times 5^3$ are decreasing prime power integers.
Let $C(n)$ be the count of decreasing prime power positive integers not exceeding $n$.
$C(100) = 94$ since all positive integers not exceeding $100$ have decreasing prime powers except $18$, $50$, $54$, $75$, $90$ and $98$.
You are given $C(10^6) = 922052$.

Title: Lattice Points in Lattice Cubes
Problem 579
Question: A lattice cube is a cube in which all vertices have integer coordinates. Let $C(n)$ be the number of different lattice cubes in which the coordinates of all vertices range between (and including) $0$ and $n$. Two cubes are hereby considered different if any of their vertices have different coordinates.
For example, $C(1)=1$, $C(2)=9$, $C(4)=100$, $C(5)=229$, $C(10)=4469$ and $C(50)=8154671$.

Different cubes may contain different numbers of lattice points.

For example, the cube with the vertices
$(0, 0, 0)$, $(3, 0, 0)$, $(0, 3, 0)$, $(0, 0, 3)$, $(0, 3, 3)$, $(3, 0, 3)$, $(3, 3, 0)$, $(3, 3, 3)$ contains $64$ lattice points ($56$ lattice points on the surface including the $8$ vertices and $8$ points within the cube). 
In contrast, the cube with the vertices
$(0, 2, 2)$, $(1, 4, 4)$, $(2, 0, 3)$, $(2, 3, 0)$, $(3, 2, 5)$, $(3, 5, 2)$, $(4, 1, 1)$, $(5, 3, 3)$ contains only $40$ lattice points ($20$ points on the surface and $20$ points within the cube), although both cubes have the same side length $3$.


Let $S(n)$ be the sum of the lattice points contained in the different lattice cubes in which the coordinates of all vertices range between (and including) $0$ and $n$.
For example, $S(1)=8$, $S(2)=91$, $S(4)=1878$, $S(5)=5832$, $S(10)=387003$ and $S(50)=29948928129$.

Title: Squarefree Hilbert Numbers

Question: 
A Hilbert number is any positive integer of the form $4k+1$ for integer $k\geq 0$.  We shall define a squarefree Hilbert number as a Hilbert number which is not divisible by the square of any Hilbert number other than one.  For example, $117$ is a squarefree Hilbert number, equaling $9\times13$.  However $6237$ is a Hilbert number that is not squarefree in this sense, as it is divisible by $9^2$.  The number $3969$ is also not squarefree, as it is divisible by both $9^2$ and $21^2$.  


There are $2327192$ squarefree Hilbert numbers below $10^7$. 
How many squarefree Hilbert numbers are there below $10^{16}$?

Title: Birthday Problem Revisited
Problem 584
Question: A long long time ago in a galaxy far far away, the Wimwians, inhabitants of planet WimWi, discovered an unmanned drone that had landed on their planet. On examining the drone, they uncovered a device that sought the answer for the so called "Birthday Problem". The description of the problem was as follows:
If people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one, what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first find 3 people with Birthdays within 1 day from each other.
The description further instructed them to enter the answer into the device and send the drone into space again. Startled by this turn of events, the Wimwians consulted their best mathematicians. Each year on Wimwi has 10 days and the mathematicians assumed equally likely birthdays and ignored leap years (leap years in Wimwi have 11 days), and found 5.78688636 to be the required answer. As such, the Wimwians entered this answer and sent the drone back into space.
After traveling light years away, the drone then landed on planet Joka. The same events ensued except this time, the numbers in the device had changed due to some unknown technical issues. The description read:
If people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one, what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first find 3 people with Birthdays within 7 days from each other.
With a 100-day year on the planet, the Jokars (inhabitants of Joka) found the answer to be 8.48967364 (rounded to 8 decimal places because the device allowed only 8 places after the decimal point) assuming equally likely birthdays. They too entered the answer into the device and launched the drone into space again.
This time the drone landed on planet Earth. As before the numbers in the problem description had changed. It read:
If people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one, what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first find 4 people with Birthdays within 7 days from each other.
What would be the answer (rounded to eight places after the decimal point) the people of Earth have to enter into the device for a year with 365 days? Ignore leap years. Also assume that all birthdays are equally likely and independent of each other.

Title: Nested Square Roots
Problem 585
Question: Consider the term $\small \sqrt{x+\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z}}$ that is representing a nested square root. $x$, $y$ and $z$ are positive integers and $y$ and $z$ are not allowed to be perfect squares, so the number below the outer square root is irrational. Still it can be shown that for some combinations of $x$, $y$ and $z$ the given term can be simplified into a sum and/or difference of simple square roots of integers, actually denesting the square roots in the initial expression. 
Here are some examples of this denesting:
$\small \sqrt{3+\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2}}=\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{1}=\sqrt{2}+1$
$\small \sqrt{8+\sqrt{15}+\sqrt{15}}=\sqrt{5}+\sqrt{3}$
$\small \sqrt{20+\sqrt{96}+\sqrt{12}}=\sqrt{9}+\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{2}=3+\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{2}$
$\small \sqrt{28+\sqrt{160}+\sqrt{108}}=\sqrt{15}+\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{5}-\sqrt{2}$
As you can see the integers used in the denested expression may also be perfect squares resulting in further simplification.
Let F($n$) be the number of different terms $\small \sqrt{x+\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z}}$, that can be denested into the sum and/or difference of a finite number of square roots, given the additional condition that $0<x \le n$. That is,
$\small \displaystyle \sqrt{x+\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z}}=\sum_{i=1}^k s_i\sqrt{a_i}$
with $k$, $x$, $y$, $z$ and all $a_i$ being positive integers, all $s_i =\pm 1$ and $x\le n$. Furthermore $y$ and $z$  are not allowed to be perfect squares.
Nested roots with the same value are not considered different, for example $\small \sqrt{7+\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{27}}$, $\small \sqrt{7+\sqrt{12}+\sqrt{12}}$ and $\small \sqrt{7+\sqrt{27}+\sqrt{3}}$, that can all three be denested into $\small 2+\sqrt{3}$, would only be counted once.
You are given that $F(10)=17$, $F(15)=46$, $F(20)=86$, $F(30)=213$ and $F(100)=2918$ and $F(5000)=11134074$.

We shall call the blue shaded region the L-section.
A line is drawn from the bottom left of the square to the top right as shown in the diagram on the right.
We shall call the orange shaded region a concave triangle.


It should be clear that the concave triangle occupies exactly half of the L-section.



Two circles are placed next to each other horizontally, a rectangle is drawn around both circles, and a line is drawn from the bottom left to the top right as shown in the diagram below.


This time the concave triangle occupies approximately 36.46% of the L-section.


If $n$ circles are placed next to each other horizontally, a rectangle is drawn around the n circles, and a line is drawn from the bottom left to the top right, then it can be shown that the least value of n for which the concave triangle occupies less than 10% of the L-section is $n = 15$.


What is the least value of $n$ for which the concave triangle occupies less than 0.1% of the L-section?

Title: Quintinomial Coefficients
Problem 588
Question: 
The coefficients in the expansion of $(x+1)^k$ are called binomial coefficients.
Analoguously the coefficients in the expansion of $(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)^k$ are called quintinomial coefficients. (quintus= Latin for fifth).


Consider the expansion of $(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)^3$:
$x^{12}+3x^{11}+6x^{10}+10x^9+15x^8+18x^7+19x^6+18x^5+15x^4+10x^3+6x^2+3x+1$
As we can see $7$ out of the $13$ quintinomial coefficients for $k=3$ are odd.


Let $Q(k)$ be the number of odd coefficients in the expansion of $(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)^k$.
So $Q(3)=7$.


You are given $Q(10)=17$ and $Q(100)=35$.

Find $\sum_{k=1}^{18}Q(10^k)$.

Title: Poohsticks Marathon
Problem 589
Question: 
Christopher Robin and Pooh Bear love the game of Poohsticks so much that they invented a new version which allows them to play for longer before one of them wins and they have to go home for tea. The game starts as normal with both dropping a stick simultaneously on the upstream side of a bridge. But rather than the game ending when one of the sticks emerges on the downstream side, instead they fish their sticks out of the water, and drop them back in again on the upstream side. The game only ends when one of the sticks emerges from under the bridge ahead of the other one having also 'lapped' the other stick - that is, having made one additional journey under the bridge compared to the other stick.


On a particular day when playing this game, the time taken for a stick to travel under the bridge varies between a minimum of 30 seconds, and a maximum of 60 seconds. The time taken to fish a stick out of the water and drop it back in again on the other side is 5 seconds. The current under the bridge has the unusual property that the sticks' journey time is always an integral number of seconds, and it is equally likely to emerge at any of the possible times between 30 and 60 seconds (inclusive). It turns out that under these circumstances, the expected time for playing a single game is 1036.15 seconds (rounded to 2 decimal places). This time is measured from the point of dropping the sticks for the first time, to the point where the winning stick emerges from under the bridge having lapped the other.


The stream flows at different rates each day, but maintains the property that the journey time in seconds is equally distributed amongst the integers from a minimum, $n$, to a maximum, $m$, inclusive. Let the expected time of play in seconds be $E(m,n)$. Hence $E(60,30)=1036.15...$

Title: Sets with a Given Least Common Multiple
Problem 590
Question: 
Let $H(n)$ denote the number of sets of positive integers such that the least common multiple of the integers in the set equals $n$.
E.g.:
The integers in the following ten sets all have a least common multiple of $6$:
$\{2,3\}$, $\{1,2,3\}$, $\{6\}$, $\{1,6\}$, $\{2,6\}$, $\{1,2,6\}$, $\{3,6\}$, $\{1,3,6\}$, $\{2,3,6\}$ and $\{1,2,3,6\}$.
Thus $H(6)=10$.


Let $L(n)$ denote the least common multiple of the numbers $1$ through $n$.
E.g. $L(6)$ is the least common multiple of the numbers $1,2,3,4,5,6$ and $L(6)$ equals $60$.


Let $HL(n)$ denote $H(L(n))$.
You are given $HL(4)=H(12)=44$.


Find $HL(50000)$. Give your answer modulo $10^9$.

Title: Best Approximations by Quadratic Integers
Problem 591
Question: Given a non-square integer $d$, any real $x$ can be approximated arbitrarily close by quadratic integers $a+b\sqrt{d}$, where $a,b$ are integers. For example, the following inequalities approximate $\pi$ with precision $10^{-13}$:
$$4375636191520\sqrt{2}-6188084046055 < \pi < 721133315582\sqrt{2}-1019836515172 $$ 
We call $BQA_d(x,n)$ the quadratic integer closest to $x$ with the absolute values of $a,b$ not exceeding $n$. We also define the integral part of a quadratic integer as $I_d(a+b\sqrt{d}) = a$.
You are given that:
Find the sum of $|I_d(BQA_d(\pi,10^{13}))|$ for all  non-square positive integers less than 100.

Title: Fleeting Medians
Problem 593
Question: We define two sequences $S = \{S(1), S(2), ..., S(n)\}$ and $S_2 = \{S_2(1), S_2(2), ..., S_2(n)\}$:
$S(k) = (p_k)^k \bmod 10007$ where $p_k$ is the $k$th prime number.
$S_2(k) = S(k) + S(\lfloor\frac{k}{10000}\rfloor + 1)$ where $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ denotes the floor function.
Then let $M(i, j)$ be the median of elements $S_2(i)$ through $S_2(j)$, inclusive. For example, $M(1, 10) = 2021.5$ and $M(10^2, 10^3) = 4715.0$.
Let $F(n, k) = \sum_{i=1}^{n-k+1} M(i, i + k - 1)$. For example, $F(100, 10) = 463628.5$ and $F(10^5, 10^4) = 675348207.5$.
Find $F(10^7, 10^5)$. If the sum is not an integer, use $.5$ to denote a half. Otherwise, use $.0$ instead.

Title: Rhombus Tilings
Problem 594
Question: 
For a polygon $P$, let $t(P)$ be the number of ways in which $P$ can be tiled using rhombi and squares with edge length 1. Distinct rotations and reflections are counted as separate tilings.


For example, if $O$ is a regular octagon with edge length 1, then $t(O) = 8$. As it happens, all these 8 tilings are rotations of one another:


Let $O_{a,b}$ be the equal-angled convex octagon whose edges alternate in length between $a$ and $b$.

For example, here is $O_{2,1}$, with one of its tilings:


You are given that $t(O_{1,1})=8$, $t(O_{2,1})=76$ and $t(O_{3,2})=456572$.

Title: Torpids
Problem 597
Question: 
Suppose that, in a particular race, each boat $B_j$ rows at a steady speed $v_j = -$log$X_j$ metres per second, where the $X_j$ are chosen randomly (with uniform distribution) between 0 and 1, independently from one another. These speeds are relative to the riverbank: you may disregard the flow of the river.


Let $p(n,L)$ be the probability that the new order is an even permutation of the starting order, when there are $n$ boats in the division and $L$ is the course length.


For example, with $n=3$ and $L=160$, labelling the boats as $A$,$B$,$C$ in starting order with $C$ highest, the different possible outcomes of the race are as follows:


Therefore, $p(3,160) = 4/15 + 4/27 = 56/135$.


You are also given that $p(4,400)=0.5107843137$, rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point.

Title: Split Divisibilities

Question:

There are five pairs of integers $a$ and $b$ ($a \leq b$) such that $a \times b=48$: $(1,48)$, $(2,24)$, $(3,16)$, $(4,12)$ and $(6,8)$.
It can be seen that both $6$ and $8$ have $4$ divisors.
So of those five pairs one consists of two integers with the same number of divisors.

In general:
Let $C(n)$ be the number of pairs of positive integers $a \times b=n$, ($a \leq b$) such that $a$ and $b$ have the same number of divisors; so $C(48)=1$.


You are given $C(10!)=3$: $(1680, 2160)$, $(1800, 2016)$ and $(1890,1920)$.

Title: Distinct Colourings of a Rubik's Cube
Problem 599
Question: 
The well-known Rubik's Cube puzzle has many fascinating mathematical properties. The 2×2×2 variant has 8 cubelets with a total of 24 visible faces, each with a coloured sticker. Successively turning faces will rearrange the cubelets, although not all arrangements of cubelets are reachable without dismantling the puzzle.


Suppose that we wish to apply new stickers to a 2×2×2 Rubik's cube in a non-standard colouring. Specifically, we have $n$ different colours available (with an unlimited supply of stickers of each colour), and we place one sticker on each of the 24 faces in any arrangement that we please. We are not required to use all the colours, and if desired the same colour may appear in more than one face of a single cubelet.


We say that two such colourings $c_1,c_2$ are essentially distinct if a cube coloured according to $c_1$ cannot be made to match a cube coloured according to $c_2$ by performing mechanically possible Rubik's Cube moves.


For example, with two colours available, there are 183 essentially distinct colourings.


How many essentially distinct colourings are there with 10 different colours available?

Title: Divisibility Streaks
Problem 601
Question: 
For every positive number $n$ we define the function $\mathop{streak}(n)=k$ as the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $n+k$ is not divisible by $k+1$.
E.g:
$13$ is divisible by $1$
$14$ is divisible by $2$
$15$ is divisible by $3$
$16$ is divisible by $4$
$17$ is NOT divisible by $5$
So $\mathop{streak}(13) = 4$.  
Similarly:
$120$ is divisible by $1$
$121$ is NOT divisible by $2$
So $\mathop{streak}(120) = 1$.


Define $P(s, N)$ to be the number of integers $n$, $1 \lt n \lt N$, for which $\mathop{streak}(n) = s$.
So $P(3, 14) = 1$ and $P(6, 10^6) = 14286$.


Find the sum, as $i$ ranges from $1$ to $31$, of $P(i, 4^i)$.

Title: Product of Head Counts
Problem 602
Question: 
Alice enlists the help of some friends to generate a random number, using a single unfair coin. She and her friends sit around a table and, starting with Alice, they take it in turns to toss the coin. Everyone keeps a count of how many heads they obtain individually. The process ends as soon as Alice obtains a Head. At this point, Alice multiplies all her friends' Head counts together to obtain her random number.


As an illustration, suppose Alice is assisted by Bob, Charlie, and Dawn, who are seated round the table in that order, and that they obtain the sequence of Head/Tail outcomes THHH—TTTT—THHT—H beginning and ending with Alice. Then Bob and Charlie each obtain 2 heads, and Dawn obtains 1 head. Alice's random number is therefore $2\times 2\times 1 = 4$.


Define $e(n, p)$ to be the expected value of Alice's random number, where $n$ is the number of friends helping (excluding Alice herself), and $p$ is the probability of the coin coming up Tails.


It turns out that, for any fixed $n$, $e(n, p)$ is always a polynomial in $p$. For example, $e(3, p) = p^3 + 4p^2 + p$.


Define $c(n, k)$ to be the coefficient of $p^k$ in the polynomial $e(n, p)$. So $c(3, 1) = 1$, $c(3, 2) = 4$, and $c(3, 3) = 1$.


You are given that $c(100, 40) \equiv 986699437 \text{ } (\text{mod } 10^9+7)$.


Find $c(10000000, 4000000) \mod 10^9+7$.

Title: Pairwise Coin-Tossing Game
Problem 605
Question: Consider an $n$-player game played in consecutive pairs: Round $1$ takes place between players $1$ and $2$, round $2$ takes place between players $2$ and $3$, and so on and so forth, all the way up to round $n$, which takes place between players $n$ and $1$. Then round $n+1$ takes place between players $1$ and $2$ as the entire cycle starts again.
In other words, during round $r$, player $((r-1) \bmod n) + 1$ faces off against player $(r \bmod n) + 1$.
During each round, a fair coin is tossed to decide which of the two players wins that round. If any given player wins both rounds $r$ and $r+1$, then that player wins the entire game.
Let $P_n(k)$ be the probability that player $k$ wins in an $n$-player game, in the form of a reduced fraction. For example, $P_3(1) = 12/49$ and $P_6(2) = 368/1323$.
Let $M_n(k)$ be the product of the reduced numerator and denominator of $P_n(k)$. For example, $M_3(1) = 588$ and $M_6(2) = 486864$.
Find the last $8$ digits of $M_{10^8+7}(10^4+7)$.

Title: Marsh Crossing
Problem 607
Question: 
Frodo and Sam need to travel 100 leagues due East from point A to point B. On normal terrain, they can cover 10 leagues per day, and so the journey would take 10 days. However, their path is crossed by a long marsh which runs exactly South-West to North-East, and walking through the marsh will slow them down. The marsh is 50 leagues wide at all points, and the mid-point of AB is located in the middle of the marsh. A map of the region is shown in the diagram below:


The marsh consists of 5 distinct regions, each 10 leagues across, as shown by the shading in the map. The strip closest to point A is relatively light marsh, and can be crossed at a speed of 9 leagues per day. However, each strip becomes progressively harder to navigate, the speeds going down to 8, 7, 6 and finally 5 leagues per day for the final region of marsh, before it ends and the terrain becomes easier again, with the speed going back to 10 leagues per day.


If Frodo and Sam were to head directly East for point B, they would travel exactly 100 leagues, and the journey would take approximately 13.4738 days. However, this time can be shortened if they deviate from the direct path.


Find the shortest possible time required to travel from point A to B, and give your answer in days, rounded to 10 decimal places.

Title: Roman Numerals II
Problem 610
Question: A random generator produces a sequence of symbols drawn from the set {I, V, X, L, C, D, M, #}. Each item in the sequence is determined by selecting one of these symbols at random, independently of the other items in the sequence. At each step, the seven letters are equally likely to be selected, with probability 14% each, but the # symbol only has a 2% chance of selection.
We write down the sequence of letters from left to right as they are generated, and we stop at the first occurrence of the # symbol (without writing it). However, we stipulate that what we have written down must always (when non-empty) be a valid Roman numeral representation in minimal form. If appending the next letter would contravene this then we simply skip it and try again with the next symbol generated.
Please take careful note of About... Roman Numerals for the definitive rules for this problem on what constitutes a "valid Roman numeral representation" and "minimal form". For example, the (only) sequence that represents 49 is XLIX. The subtractive combination IL is invalid because of rule (ii), while XXXXIX is valid but not minimal. The rules do not place any restriction on the number of occurrences of M, so all positive integers have a valid representation. These are the same rules as were used in Problem 89, and members are invited to solve that problem first.
Find the expected value of the number represented by what we have written down when we stop. (If nothing is written down then count that as zero.) Give your answer rounded to 8 places after the decimal point.

Title: Mirror Power Sequence
Problem 617
Question: For two integers $n,e \gt 1$, we define an $(n,e)$-MPS (Mirror Power Sequence) to be an infinite sequence of integers $(a_i)_{i\ge 0}$ such that for all $i\ge 0$, $a_{i+1} = \min(a_i^e,n-a_i^e)$ and $a_i \gt 1$. Examples of such sequences are the two $(18,2)$-MPS sequences made of alternating $2$ and $4$.
Note that even though such a sequence is uniquely determined by $n,e$ and $a_0$, for most values such a sequence does not exist. For example, no $(n,e)$-MPS exists for $n \lt 6$.
Define $C(n)$ to be the number of $(n,e)$-MPS for some $e$, and $\displaystyle D(N) = \sum_{n=2}^N C(n)$.
You are given that $D(10) = 2$, $D(100) = 21$, $D(1000) = 69$, $D(10^6) = 1303$ and $D(10^{12}) = 1014800$.

Title: Numbers with a Given Prime Factor Sum
Problem 618
Question: Consider the numbers $15$, $16$ and $18$:
$15=3\times 5$ and $3+5=8$.
$16 = 2\times 2\times 2\times 2$ and $2+2+2+2=8$.
$18 = 2\times 3\times 3$ and $2+3+3=8$. 

$15$, $16$ and $18$ are the only numbers that have $8$ as sum of the prime factors (counted with multiplicity).

We define $S(k)$ to be the sum of all numbers $n$ where the sum of the prime factors (with multiplicity)  of $n$ is $k$.
Hence $S(8) = 15+16+18 = 49$.
Other examples: $S(1) = 0$, $S(2) = 2$, $S(3) = 3$, $S(5) = 5 + 6 = 11$.

The Fibonacci sequence is $F_1 = 1$, $F_2 = 1$, $F_3 = 2$, $F_4 = 3$, $F_5 = 5$, ....
Find the last nine digits of $\displaystyle\sum_{k=2}^{24}S(F_k)$.

Title: Square Subsets
Problem 619
Question: For a set of positive integers $\{a, a+1, a+2, \dots , b\}$, let $C(a,b)$ be the number of non-empty subsets in which the product of all elements is a perfect square.
For example $C(5,10)=3$, since the products of all elements of $\{5, 8, 10\}$, $\{5, 8, 9, 10\}$ and $\{9\}$ are perfect squares, and no other subsets of $\{5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$ have this property.
You are given that $C(40,55) =15$, and $C(1000,1234) \bmod 1000000007=975523611$.

Title: Planetary Gears
Problem 620
Question: A circle $C$ of circumference $c$ centimetres has a smaller circle $S$ of circumference $s$ centimetres lying off-centre within it. Four other distinct circles, which we call "planets", with circumferences $p$, $p$, $q$, $q$ centimetres respectively ($p<q$), are inscribed within $C$ but outside $S$, with each planet touching both $C$ and $S$ tangentially. The planets are permitted to overlap one another, but the boundaries of $S$ and $C$ must be at least 1cm apart at their closest point.
Now suppose that these circles are actually gears with perfectly meshing teeth at a pitch of 1cm. $C$ is an internal gear with teeth on the inside. We require that $c$, $s$, $p$, $q$ are all integers (as they are the numbers of teeth), and we further stipulate that any gear must have at least 5 teeth.
Note that "perfectly meshing" means that as the gears rotate, the ratio between their angular velocities remains constant, and the teeth of one gear perfectly align with the groves of the other gear and vice versa. Only for certain gear sizes and positions will it be possible for $S$ and $C$ each to mesh perfectly with all the planets. Arrangements where not all gears mesh perfectly are not valid.
Define $g(c,s,p,q)$ to be the number of such gear arrangements for given values of $c$, $s$, $p$, $q$: it turns out that this is finite as only certain discrete arrangements are possible satisfying the above conditions. For example, $g(16,5,5,6)=9$.
Here is one such arrangement:
Let $G(n) = \sum_{s+p+q\le n} g(s+p+q,s,p,q)$ where the sum only includes cases with $p<q$, $p\ge 5$, and $s\ge 5$, all integers. You are given that $G(16)=9$ and $G(20)=205$.
Find $G(500)$.

Title: Expressing an Integer as the Sum of Triangular Numbers
Problem 621
Question: Gauss famously proved that every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of three triangular numbers (including $0$ as the lowest triangular number). In fact most numbers can be expressed as a sum of three triangular numbers in several ways.

Let $G(n)$ be the number of ways of expressing $n$ as the sum of three triangular numbers, regarding different arrangements of the terms of the sum as distinct.

For example, $G(9) = 7$, as $9$ can be expressed as: $3+3+3$, $0+3+6$, $0+6+3$, $3+0+6$, $3+6+0$, $6+0+3$, $6+3+0$.  
You are given $G(1000) = 78$ and $G(10^6) = 2106$.

Find $G(17526 \times 10^9)$.

Title: Riffle Shuffles
Problem 622
Question: 
A riffle shuffle is executed as follows: a deck of cards is split into two equal halves, with the top half taken in the left hand and the bottom half taken in the right hand. Next, the cards are interleaved exactly, with the top card in the right half inserted just after the top card in the left half, the 2nd card in the right half just after the 2nd card in the left half, etc. (Note that this process preserves the location of the top and bottom card of the deck)


Let $s(n)$ be the minimum number of consecutive riffle shuffles needed to restore a deck of size $n$ to its original configuration, where $n$ is a positive even number.

Amazingly, a standard deck of $52$ cards will first return to its original configuration after only $8$ perfect shuffles, so $s(52) = 8$. It can be verified that a deck of $86$ cards will also return to its original configuration after exactly $8$ shuffles, and the sum of all values of $n$ that satisfy $s(n) = 8$ is $412$.


Find the sum of all values of n that satisfy $s(n) = 60$.

Title: Lambda Count
Problem 623
Question: The lambda-calculus is a universal model of computation at the core of functional programming languages. It is based on lambda-terms, a minimal programming language featuring only function definitions, function calls and variables. Lambda-terms are built according to the following rules:
A lambda-term $T$ is said to be closed if for all variables $x$, all occurrences of $x$ within $T$ are contained within some abstraction $(\lambda x. M)$ in $T$. The smallest such abstraction is said to bind the occurrence of the variable $x$. In other words, a lambda-term is closed if all its variables are bound to parameters of enclosing functions definitions. For example, the term $(\lambda x. x)$ is closed, while the term $(\lambda x. (x y))$ is not because $y$ is not bound.
Also, we can rename variables as long as no binding abstraction changes. This means that $(\lambda x. x)$ and $(\lambda y. y)$ should be considered equivalent since we merely renamed a parameter. Two terms equivalent modulo such renaming are called $\alpha$-equivalent. Note that $(\lambda x. (\lambda y. (x y)))$ and $(\lambda x. (\lambda x. (x x)))$ are not $\alpha$-equivalent, since the abstraction binding the first variable was the outer one and becomes the inner one. However, $(\lambda x. (\lambda y. (x y)))$ and $(\lambda y. (\lambda x. (y x)))$ are $\alpha$-equivalent.
The following table regroups the lambda-terms that can be written with at most $15$ symbols, symbols being parenthesis, $\lambda$, dot and variables.
Let be $\Lambda(n)$ the number of distinct closed lambda-terms that can be written using at most $n$ symbols, where terms that are $\alpha$-equivalent to one another should be counted only once. You are given that $\Lambda(6) = 1$, $\Lambda(9) = 2$, $\Lambda(15) = 20$ and $\Lambda(35) = 3166438$.
Find $\Lambda(2000)$. Give the answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.

Title: Two Heads Are Better Than One
Problem 624
Question: 
An unbiased coin is tossed repeatedly until two consecutive heads are obtained. Suppose these occur on the $(M-1)$th and $M$th toss.
Let $P(n)$ be the probability that $M$ is divisible by $n$. For example, the outcomes HH, HTHH, and THTTHH all count towards $P(2)$, but THH and HTTHH do not.

You are given that $P(2) =\frac 3 5$ and $P(3)=\frac 9  {31}$. Indeed, it can be shown that $P(n)$ is always a rational number.

For a prime $p$ and a fully reduced fraction $\frac a b$, define $Q(\frac a b,p)$ to be the smallest positive $q$ for which $a \equiv b q \pmod{p}$.
For example $Q(P(2), 109) = Q(\frac 3 5, 109) = 66$, because $5 \cdot 66 = 330 \equiv 3 \pmod{109}$ and $66$ is the smallest positive such number.
Similarly $Q(P(3),109) = 46$.

Find $Q(P(10^{18}),1\,000\,000\,009)$.

via the sequence of two transformations "Flip all elements in column 3" followed by "Swap rows 1 and 2".
Define $c(n)$ to be the maximum number of $n\times n$ binary matrices that can be found such that no two are equivalent. For example, $c(3)=3$. You are also given that $c(5)=39$ and $c(8)=656108$.

Title: Open Chess Positions
Problem 628
Question: 
A position in chess is an (orientated) arrangement of chess pieces placed on a chessboard of given size. In the following, we consider all positions in which $n$ pawns are placed on a  $n \times n$  
board in such a way, that there is a single pawn in every row and every column.



We call such a position an open position, if a rook, starting at the (empty) lower left corner and using only moves towards the right or upwards, can reach the upper right corner without moving onto any field occupied by a pawn. 

Let $f(n)$ be the number of open positions for a $n \times n$ chessboard.
For example, $f(3)=2$, illustrated by the two open positions for a $3 \times 3$ chessboard below.



You are also given $f(5)=70$.
Find $f(10^8)$ modulo $1\,008\,691\,207$.

Title: Scatterstone Nim
Problem 629
Question: Alice and Bob are playing a modified game of Nim called Scatterstone Nim, with Alice going first, alternating turns with Bob. The game begins with an arbitrary set of stone piles with a total number of stones equal to $n$.
During a player's turn, he/she must pick a pile having at least $2$ stones and perform a split operation, dividing the pile into an arbitrary set of $p$ non-empty, arbitrarily-sized piles where $2 \leq p \leq k$ for some fixed constant $k$. For example, a pile of size $4$ can be split into $\{1, 3\}$ or $\{2, 2\}$, or $\{1, 1, 2\}$ if $k = 3$ and in addition $\{1, 1, 1, 1\}$ if $k = 4$.
If no valid move is possible on a given turn, then the other player wins the game.
A winning position is defined as a set of stone piles where a player can ultimately ensure victory no matter what the other player does.
Let $f(n,k)$ be the number of winning positions for Alice on her first turn, given parameters $n$ and $k$. For example, $f(5, 2) = 3$ with winning positions $\{1, 1, 1, 2\}, \{1, 4\}, \{2, 3\}$. In contrast, $f(5, 3) = 5$ with winning positions $\{1, 1, 1, 2\}, \{1, 1, 3\}, \{1, 4\}, \{2, 3\}, \{5\}$.
Let $g(n)$ be the sum of $f(n,k)$ over all $2 \leq k \leq n$. For example, $g(7)=66$ and $g(10)=291$.
Find $g(200) \bmod (10^9 + 7)$.

Title: Crossed Lines
Problem 630
Question: 
Given a set, $L$, of unique lines, let $M(L)$ be the number of lines in the set and let $S(L)$ be the sum over every line of the number of times that line is crossed by another line in the set.  For example, two sets of three lines are shown below:


In both cases $M(L)$ is $3$ and $S(L)$ is $6$: each of the three lines is crossed by two other lines. Note that even if the lines cross at a single point, all of the separate crossings of lines are counted.


Consider points $(T_{2k-1}, T_{2k})$, for integer $k \ge 1$, generated in the following way:


$S_0 	=  	290797$ 
$S_{n+1} 	=  	S_n^2 \bmod 50515093$
$T_n 	=  	(S_n \bmod 2000) - 1000$


For example, the first three points are: $(527, 144)$, $(-488, 732)$, $(-454, -947)$. Given the first $n$ points generated in this manner, let $L_n$ be the set of unique lines that can be formed by joining each point with every other point, the lines being extended indefinitely in both directions.  We can then define $M(L_n)$ and $S(L_n)$ as described above.


For example, $M(L_3) = 3$ and $S(L_3) = 6$. Also $M(L_{100}) = 4948$ and $S(L_{100}) = 24477690$.

Title: Constrained Permutations
Problem 631
Question: Let $(p_1 p_2 \ldots p_k)$ denote the permutation of the set ${1, ..., k}$ that maps $p_i\mapsto i$. Define the length of the permutation to be $k$; note that the empty permutation $()$ has length zero.
Define an occurrence of a permutation $p=(p_1 p_2 \cdots p_k)$ in a permutation $P=(P_1 P_2 \cdots P_n)$ to be a sequence $1\leq t_1 \lt t_2 \lt \cdots \lt t_k \leq n$ such that $p_i \lt p_j$ if and only if $P_{t_i} \lt P_{t_j}$ for all $i,j \in \{1, \dots, k\}$.
For example, $(1243)$ occurs twice in the permutation $(314625)$: once as the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 6th elements $(3\,\,46\,\,5)$, and once as the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th elements $(\,\,146\,\,5)$.
Let $f(n, m)$ be the number of permutations $P$ of length at most $n$ such that there is no occurrence of the permutation $1243$ in $P$ and there are at most $m$ occurrences of the permutation $21$ in $P$.
For example, $f(2,0) = 3$, with the permutations $()$, $(1)$, $(1,2)$ but not $(2,1)$.
You are also given that $f(4, 5) = 32$ and $f(10, 25) = 294\,400$.

Title: Restricted Factorisations
Problem 636
Question: Consider writing a natural number as product of powers of natural numbers with given exponents, additionally requiring different base numbers for each power.
For example, $256$ can be written as a product of a square and a fourth power in three ways such that the base numbers are different.
That is, $256=1^2\times 4^4=4^2\times 2^4=16^2\times 1^4$
Though $4^2$ and $2^4$ are both equal, we are concerned only about the base numbers in this problem. Note that permutations are not considered distinct, for example $16^2\times 1^4$ and $1^4 \times 16^2$ are considered to be the same.
Similarly, $10!$ can be written as a product of one natural number, two squares and three cubes in two ways ($10!=42\times5^2\times4^2\times3^3\times2^3\times1^3=21\times5^2\times2^2\times4^3\times3^3\times1^3$) whereas $20!$ can be given the same representation in $41680$ ways.
Let $F(n)$ denote the number of ways in which $n$ can be written as a product of one natural number, two squares, three cubes and four fourth powers.
You are given that $F(25!)=4933$, $F(100!) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007=693\,952\,493$,

Each turn, Bob rolls both dice, getting numbers $x$ and $y$ respectively, each in the range 1,...,6. He must choose amongst three options: turn over card $x$, card $y$, or card $x+y$. (If the chosen card is already face down, it is turned to face up, and vice versa.)
If Bob manages to have all twelve cards face down at the same time, he wins.
Alice plays a similar game, except that instead of dice she uses two fair coins, counting heads as 2 and tails as 1, and that she uses four cards instead of twelve. Alice finds that, with the optimal strategy for her game, the expected number of turns taken until she wins is approximately 5.673651.
Assuming that Bob plays with an optimal strategy, what is the expected number of turns taken until he wins? Give your answer rounded to 6 places after the decimal point.

Title: A Long Row of Dice
Problem 641
Question: Consider a row of $n$ dice all showing 1.
First turn every second die,$ (2,4,6,\ldots)$, so that the number showing is increased by 1. Then turn every third die. The sixth die will now show a 3. Then turn every fourth die and so on until every $n$th die (only the last die) is turned. If the die to be turned is showing a 6 then it is changed to show a 1.
Let $f(n)$ be the number of dice that are showing a 1 when the process finishes. You are given $f(100)=2$ and $f(10^8) = 69$.
Find $f(10^{36})$.

Title: $2$-Friendly
Problem 643
Question: Two positive integers $a$ and $b$ are $2$-friendly when $\gcd(a,b) = 2^t, t \gt 0$. For example, $24$ and $40$ are $2$-friendly because $\gcd(24,40) = 8 = 2^3$ while $24$ and $36$ are not because $\gcd(24,36) = 12 = 2^2\cdot 3$ not a power of $2$.
Let $f(n)$ be the number of pairs, $(p,q)$, of positive integers with $1\le p\lt q\le n$ such that $p$ and $q$ are $2$-friendly. You are given $f(10^2) = 1031$ and $f(10^6) = 321418433$ modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.

Title: Squares on the Line
Problem 644
Question: Sam and Tom are trying a game of (partially) covering a given line segment of length $L$ by taking turns in placing unit squares onto the line segment. 
As illustrated below, the squares may be positioned in two different ways, either "straight" by placing the midpoints of two opposite sides on the line segment, or "diagonal" by placing two opposite corners on the line segment. Newly placed squares may touch other squares, but are not allowed to overlap any other square laid down before.
The player who is able to place the last unit square onto the line segment wins.

With Sam starting each game by placing the first square, they quickly realise that Sam can easily win every time by placing the first square in the middle of the line segment, making the game boring. 

Therefore they decide to randomise Sam's first move, by first tossing a fair coin to determine whether the square will be placed straight or diagonal onto the line segment and then choosing the actual position on the line segment randomly with all possible positions being equally likely. Sam's gain of the game is defined to be 0 if he loses the game and $L$ if he wins. Assuming optimal play of both players after Sam's initial move, you can see that Sam's expected gain, called $e(L)$, is only dependent on the length of the line segment.

For example, if $L=2$, Sam will win with a probability of $1$, so $e(2)= 2$. 
Choosing $L=4$, the winning probability will be $0.33333333$ for the straight case and $0.22654092$ for the diagonal case, leading to $e(4)=1.11974851$ (rounded to $8$ digits after the decimal point each).

Being interested in the optimal value of $L$ for Sam, let's define $f(a,b)$ to be the maximum of $e(L)$ for some $L \in [a,b]$. 
You are given $f(2,10)=2.61969775$, being reached for $L= 7.82842712$, and $f(10,20)=
5.99374121$ (rounded to $8$ digits each).

Find $f(200,500)$, rounded to $8$ digits after the decimal point.

Title: Linear Transformations of Polygonal Numbers
Problem 647
Question: 
It is possible to find positive integers $A$ and $B$ such that given any triangular number, $T_n$, then $AT_n +B$ is always a triangular number. We define $F_3(N)$ to be the sum of $(A+B)$ over all such possible pairs $(A,B)$ with $\max(A,B)\le N$. For example $F_3(100) = 184$.


Polygonal numbers are generalisations of triangular numbers. Polygonal numbers with parameter $k$ we call $k$-gonal numbers. The formula for the $n$th $k$-gonal number is $\frac 12n\big(n(k-2)+4-k\big)$ where $n \ge 1$. For example when $k = 3$ we get $\frac 12n(n+1)$ the formula for triangular numbers.


The statement above is true for pentagonal, heptagonal and in fact any $k$-gonal number with $k$ odd. For example when $k=5$ we get the pentagonal numbers and we can find positive integers $A$ and $B$ such that given any pentagonal number, $P_n$, then $AP_n+B$ is always a pentagonal number. We define $F_5(N)$ to be the sum of $(A+B)$ over all such possible pairs $(A,B)$ with $\max(A,B)\le N$.


Similarly we define $F_k(N)$ for odd $k$. You are given $\sum_{k} F_k(10^3) = 14993$ where the sum is over all odd $k = 3,5,7,\ldots$.


Find $\sum_{k} F_k(10^{12})$ where the sum is over all odd $k = 3,5,7,\ldots$

Title: Skipping Squares
Problem 648
Question: For some fixed $\rho \in [0, 1]$, we begin a sum $s$ at $0$ and repeatedly apply a process: With probability $\rho$, we add $1$ to $s$, otherwise we add $2$ to $s$.
The process ends when either $s$ is a perfect square or $s$ exceeds $10^{18}$, whichever occurs first. For example, if $s$ goes through $0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9$, the process ends at $s=9$, and two squares $1$ and $4$ were skipped over.
Let $f(\rho)$ be the expected number of perfect squares skipped over when the process finishes.
It can be shown that the power series for $f(\rho)$ is $\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k \rho^k$ for a suitable (unique) choice of coefficients $a_k$. Some of the first few coefficients are $a_0=1$, $a_1=0$, $a_5=-18$, $a_{10}=45176$.
Let $F(n) = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k$. You are given that $F(10) = 53964$ and $F(50) \equiv 842418857 \pmod{10^9}$.

Title: Low-Prime Chessboard Nim
Problem 649
Question: The game may start with any arrangement of $c$ coins in squares on the board. It is possible at any time for more than one coin to occupy the same square on the board at the same time. The coins are distinguishable, so swapping two coins gives a different arrangement if (and only if) they are on different squares.
On a given turn, the player must choose a coin and move it either left or up $2$, $3$, $5$, or $7$ spaces in a single direction. The only restriction is that the coin cannot move off the edge of the board.
The game ends when a player is unable to make a valid move, thereby granting the other player the victory.
Assuming that Alice goes first and that both players are playing optimally, let $M(n, c)$ be the number of possible starting arrangements for which Alice can ensure her victory, given a board of size $n$ by $n$ with $c$ distinct coins.
For example, $M(3, 1) = 4$, $M(3, 2) = 40$, and $M(9, 3) = 450304$.
What are the last $9$ digits of $M(10\,000\,019, 100)$?

Question: 
Let $B(n) = \displaystyle \prod_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}$, a product of binomial coefficients.
For example, $B(5) = {5 \choose 0} \times {5 \choose 1} \times {5 \choose 2}  \times {5 \choose 3} \times {5 \choose 4} \times {5 \choose 5} = 1 \times 5 \times 10 \times 10 \times 5 \times 1 = 2500$.


Let $D(n) = \displaystyle \sum_{d|B(n)} d$, the sum of the divisors of $B(n)$.
For example, the divisors of B(5) are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, 500, 625, 1250 and 2500,
so D(5) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 50 + 100 + 125 + 250 + 500 + 625 + 1250 + 2500 = 5467.

Title: Patterned Cylinders
Problem 651
Question: An infinitely long cylinder has its curved surface fully covered with different coloured but otherwise identical rectangular stickers, without overlapping. The stickers are aligned with the cylinder, so two of their edges are parallel with the cylinder's axis, with four stickers meeting at each corner.
Let $a>0$ and suppose that the colouring is periodic along the cylinder, with the pattern repeating every $a$ stickers. (The period is allowed to be any divisor of $a$.) Let $b$ be the number of stickers that fit round the circumference of the cylinder.
Let $f(m, a, b)$ be the number of different such periodic patterns that use exactly $m$ distinct colours of stickers. Translations along the axis, reflections in any plane, rotations in any axis, (or combinations of such operations) applied to a pattern are to be counted as the same as the original pattern.
You are given that $f(2, 2, 3) = 11$, $f(3, 2, 3) = 56$, and $f(2, 3, 4) = 156$.

Title: Distinct Values of a Proto-logarithmic Function
Problem 652
Question: Consider the values of $\log_2(8)$, $\log_4(64)$ and $\log_3(27)$. All three are equal to $3$.
Generally, the function $f(m,n)=\log_m(n)$ over integers $m,n \ge 2$ has the property that 
$f(m_1,n_1)=f(m_2,n_2)$ if

We call a function $g(m,n)$ over integers $m,n \ge 2$ proto-logarithmic  if 

Let $D(N)$ be the number of distinct values that any proto-logarithmic function $g(m,n)$ attains over $2\le m, n\le N$.
For example, $D(5)=13$, $D(10)=69$, $D(100)=9607$ and $D(10000)=99959605$.
Find $D(10^{18})$, and give the last $9$ digits as answer.

Note: According to the four exponentials conjecture the function $\log_m(n)$ is proto-logarithmic. While this conjecture is yet unproven in general, $\log_m(n)$ can be used to calculate $D(N)$ for small values of $N$.

Title: Frictionless Tube
Problem 653
Question: Consider a horizontal frictionless tube with length $L$ millimetres, and a diameter of 20 millimetres. The east end of the tube is open, while the west end is sealed. The tube contains $N$ marbles of diameter 20 millimetres at designated starting locations, each one initially moving either westward or eastward with common speed $v$.
Since there are marbles moving in opposite directions, there are bound to be some collisions. We assume that the collisions are perfectly elastic, so both marbles involved instantly change direction and continue with speed $v$ away from the collision site. Similarly, if the west-most marble collides with the sealed end of the tube, it instantly changes direction and continues eastward at speed $v$. On the other hand, once a marble reaches the unsealed east end, it exits the tube and has no further interaction with the remaining marbles.
To obtain the starting positions and initial directions, we use the pseudo-random sequence $r_j$ defined by:
$r_1 = 6\,563\,116$
$r_{j+1} = r_j^2 \bmod 32\,745\,673$
The west-most marble is initially positioned with a gap of $(r_1 \bmod 1000) + 1$ millimetres between it and the sealed end of the tube, measured from the west-most point of the surface of the marble. Then, for $2\le j\le N$, counting from the west, the gap between the $(j-1)$th and $j$th marbles, as measured from their closest points, is given by $(r_j \bmod 1000) + 1$ millimetres.
Furthermore, the $j$th marble is initially moving eastward if $r_j \le 10\,000\,000$, and westward if $r_j > 10\,000\,000$.
For example, with $N=3$, the sequence specifies gaps of 117, 432, and 173 millimetres. The marbles' centres are therefore 127, 579, and 772 millimetres from the sealed west end of the tube. The west-most marble initially moves eastward, while the other two initially move westward.
Under this setup, and with a five metre tube ($L=5000$), it turns out that the middle (second) marble travels 5519 millimetres before its centre reaches the east-most end of the tube.
Let $d(L, N, j)$ be the distance in millimetres that the $j$th marble travels before its centre reaches the eastern end of the tube. So $d(5000, 3, 2) = 5519$. You are also given that $d(10\,000, 11, 6) = 11\,780$ and $d(100\,000, 101, 51) = 114\,101$.
Find $d(1\,000\,000\,000, 1\,000\,001, 500\,001)$.

Title: Palindromic Sequences
Problem 656
Question: 
Given an irrational number $\alpha$, let $S_\alpha(n)$ be the sequence $S_\alpha(n)=\lfloor {\alpha \cdot n} \rfloor - \lfloor {\alpha \cdot (n-1)} \rfloor$ for $n \ge 1$. 
($\lfloor \cdots \rfloor$ is the floor-function.)


It can be proven that for any irrational $\alpha$ there exist infinitely many values of $n$ such that the subsequence $ \{S_\alpha(1),S_\alpha(2)...S_\alpha(n) \} $ is palindromic.

The first $20$ values of $n$ that give a palindromic subsequence for $\alpha = \sqrt{31}$ are:
$1$, $3$, $5$, $7$, $44$, $81$, $118$, $273$, $3158$, $9201$, $15244$, $21287$, $133765$, $246243$, $358721$, $829920$, $9600319$, $27971037$, $46341755$, $64712473$.

Let $H_g(\alpha)$ be the sum of the first $g$ values of $n$  for which the corresponding subsequence is palindromic.
So $H_{20}(\sqrt{31})=150243655$.


Let $T=\{2,3,5,6,7,8,10,\dots,1000\}$ be the set of positive integers, not exceeding $1000$, excluding perfect squares.
Calculate the sum of $H_{100}(\sqrt \beta)$ for  $\beta \in T$. Give the last $15$ digits of your answer.

In fact $13$ is the largest prime dividing any two successive terms of this sequence.

Title: A Long Chess Match
Problem 661
Question: Two friends $A$ and $B$ are great fans of Chess. They both enjoy playing the game, but after each game the player who lost the game would like to continue (to get back at the other player) and the player who won would prefer to stop (to finish on a high).
So they come up with a plan. After every game, they would toss a (biased) coin with probability $p$ of Heads (and hence probability $1-p$ of Tails). If they get Tails, they will continue with the next game. Otherwise they end the match. Also, after every game the players make a note of who is leading in the match.
Let $p_A$ denote the probability of $A$ winning a game and $p_B$ the probability of $B$ winning a game. Accordingly $1-p_A-p_B$ is the probability that a game ends in a draw. Let $\mathbb{E}_A(p_A,p_B,p)$ denote the expected number of times $A$ was leading in the match.

For example, $\mathbb{E}_A(0.25,0.25,0.5)\approx 0.585786$ and $\mathbb{E}_A(0.47,0.48,0.001)\approx 377.471736$, both rounded to six places after the decimal point.
Let $\displaystyle H(n)=\sum_{k=3}^n \mathbb{E}_A\left(\frac 1 {\sqrt{k+3}},\frac 1 {\sqrt{k+3}}+\frac 1 {k^2},\frac 1 {k^3}\right)$
For example $H(3) \approx 6.8345$, rounded to 4 digits after the decimal point.
Find $H(50)$, rounded to 4 digits after the decimal point.

Title: Sums of Subarrays
Problem 663
Question: Let $t_k$ be the tribonacci numbers defined as: 
$\quad t_0 = t_1 = 0$;
$\quad t_2 = 1$; 
$\quad t_k = t_{k-1} + t_{k-2} + t_{k-3} \quad \text{   for   }  k \ge 3$.
For a given integer $n$, let $A_n$ be an array of length $n$ (indexed from $0$ to $n-1$), that is initially filled with zeros.
The array is changed iteratively by replacing $A_n[(t_{2 i-2} \bmod n)]$ with $A_n[(t_{2 i-2} \bmod n)]+2 (t_{2 i-1} \bmod n)-n+1$ in each step $i$. 
After each step $i$, define $M_n(i)$ to be $\displaystyle \max\{\sum_{j=p}^q A_n[j]: 0\le p\le q \lt n\}$, the maximal sum of any contiguous subarray of $A_n$. 
The first 6 steps for $n=5$ are illustrated below:
Initial state: $\, A_5=\{0,0,0,0,0\}$
Step 1: $\quad \Rightarrow A_5=\{-4,0,0,0,0\}$, $M_5(1)=0$
Step 2: $\quad \Rightarrow A_5=\{-4, -2, 0, 0, 0\}$, $M_5(2)=0$
Step 3: $\quad \Rightarrow A_5=\{-4, -2, 4, 0, 0\}$, $M_5(3)=4$
Step 4: $\quad \Rightarrow A_5=\{-4, -2, 6, 0, 0\}$, $M_5(4)=6$
Step 5: $\quad \Rightarrow A_5=\{-4, -2, 6, 0, 4\}$, $M_5(5)=10$
Step 6: $\quad \Rightarrow A_5=\{-4, 2, 6, 0, 4\}$, $M_5(6)=12$

Let $\displaystyle S(n,l)=\sum_{i=1}^l M_n(i)$. Thus $S(5,6)=32$.
You are given $S(5,100)=2416$, $S(14,100)=3881$ and $S(107,1000)=1618572$.
Find $S(10\,000\,003,10\,200\,000)-S(10\,000\,003,10\,000\,000)$.

Title: An Infinite Game
Problem 664
Question: Peter is playing a solitaire game on an infinite checkerboard, each square of which can hold an unlimited number of tokens.
Each move of the game consists of the following steps:
The board is marked with a line called the dividing line. Initially, every square to the left of the dividing line contains a token, and every square to the right of the dividing line is empty:
Peter's goal is to get a token as far as possible to the right in a finite number of moves. However, he quickly finds out that, even with his infinite supply of tokens, he cannot move a token more than four squares beyond the dividing line.
Peter then considers starting configurations with larger supplies of tokens: each square in the $d$th column to the left of the dividing line starts with $d^n$ tokens instead of $1$. This is illustrated below for $n=1$:
Let $F(n)$ be the maximum number of squares Peter can move a token beyond the dividing line. For example, $F(0)=4$.
You are also given that $F(1)=6$, $F(2)=9$, $F(3)=13$, $F(11)=58$ and $F(123)=1173$.
Find $F(1234567)$.

Title: Proportionate Nim
Problem 665
Question: Two players play a game with two piles of stones, alternating turns.
On each turn, the corresponding player chooses a positive integer $n$ and does one of the following:
The player who removes the last stone wins.
We denote by $(n,m)$ the position in which the piles have $n$ and $m$ stones remaining. Note that $(n,m)$ is considered to be the same position as $(m,n)$.
Then, for example, if the position is $(2,6)$, the next player may reach the following positions:
$(0,2)$, $(0,4)$, $(0,5)$, $(0,6)$, $(1,2)$, $(1,4)$, $(1,5)$, $(1,6)$, $(2,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(2,4)$, $(2,5)$
A position is a losing position if the player to move next cannot force a win. For example, $(1,3)$, $(2,6)$, $(4,5)$ are the first few losing positions.
Let $f(M)$ be the sum of $n+m$ for all losing positions $(n,m)$ with $n\le m$ and $n+m \le M$. For example, $f(10) = 21$, by considering the losing positions $(1,3)$, $(2,6)$, $(4,5)$.
You are given that $f(100) = 1164$ and $f(1000) = 117002$.
Find $f(10^7)$.

Title: Polymorphic Bacteria
Problem 666
Question: 
If a population starts with a single bacterium of type $\alpha$, then it can be shown that there is a 0.07243802 probability that the population will eventually die out, and a 0.92756198 probability that the population will last forever. These probabilities are given rounded to 8 decimal places.


Now consider another species of bacteria, $S_{k,m}$ (where $k$ and $m$ are positive integers), which occurs in $k$ different types $\alpha_i$ for $0\le i< k$. The rules governing this species' lifecycle involve the sequence $r_n$ defined by:


Every minute, for each $i$, each bacterium $A$ of type $\alpha_i$ will independently choose an integer $j$ uniformly at random in the range $0\le j<m$. What it then does depends on $q = r_{im+j} \bmod 5$:

In fact, our original species was none other than $S_{2,2}$, with $\alpha=\alpha_0$ and $\beta=\alpha_1$.


Let $P_{k,m}$ be the probability that a population of species $S_{k,m}$, starting with a single bacterium of type $\alpha_0$, will eventually die out. So $P_{2,2} = 0.07243802$. You are also given that $P_{4,3} = 0.18554021$ and $P_{10,5} = 0.53466253$, all rounded to 8 decimal places.


Find $P_{500,10}$, and give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places.

Question: 
After buying a Gerver Sofa from the Moving Sofa Company, Jack wants to buy a matching cocktail table from the same company. Most important for him is that the table can be pushed through his L-shaped corridor into the living room without having to be lifted from its table legs. 
Unfortunately, the simple square model offered to him is too small for him, so he asks for a bigger model.
He is offered the new pentagonal model illustrated below:

Note, while the shape and size can be ordered individually, due to the production process, all edges of the pentagonal table have to have the same length.

Given optimal form and size, what is the biggest pentagonal cocktail table (in terms of area) that Jack can buy that still fits through his unit wide L-shaped corridor?

Give your answer rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point (if Jack had choosen the square model instead the answer would have been 1.0000000000).

Title: The King's Banquet
Problem 669
Question: The Knights of the Order of Fibonacci are preparing a grand feast for their king. There are $n$ knights, and each knight is assigned a distinct number from $1$ to $n$.
When the knights sit down at the roundtable for their feast, they follow a peculiar seating rule: two knights can only sit next to each other if their respective numbers sum to a Fibonacci number.
When the $n$ knights all try to sit down around a circular table with $n$ chairs, they are unable to find a suitable seating arrangement for any $n>2$ despite their best efforts. Just when they are about to give up, they remember that the king will sit on his throne at the table as well.
Suppose there are $n=7$ knights and $7$ chairs at the roundtable, in addition to the king’s throne. After some trial and error, they come up with the following seating arrangement ($K$ represents the king):
Notice that the sums $4+1$, $1+7$, $7+6$, $6+2$, $2+3$, and $3+5$ are all Fibonacci numbers, as required. It should also be mentioned that the king always prefers an arrangement where the knight to the his left has a smaller number than the knight to his right. With this additional rule, the above arrangement is unique for $n=7$, and the knight sitting in the 3rd chair from the king’s left is knight number $7$.
Later, several new knights are appointed to the Order, giving $34$ knights and chairs in addition to the king's throne. The knights eventually determine that there is a unique seating arrangement for $n=34$ satisfying the above rules, and this time knight number $30$ is sitting in the 3rd chair from the king's left.
Now suppose there are $n=99\,194\,853\,094\,755\,497$ knights and the same number of chairs at the roundtable (not including the king’s throne). After great trials and tribulations, they are finally able to find the unique seating arrangement for this value of $n$ that satisfies the above rules.
Find the number of the knight sitting in the $10\,000\,000\,000\,000\,000$th chair from the king’s left.

Title: Colouring a Strip
Problem 670
Question: A certain type of tile comes in three different sizes - $1 \times 1$, $1 \times 2$, and $1 \times 3$ - and in four different colours: blue, green, red and yellow. There is an unlimited number of tiles available in each combination of size and colour.
These are used to tile a $2\times n$ rectangle, where $n$ is a positive integer, subject to the following conditions:
For example, the following is an acceptable tiling of a $2\times 12$ rectangle:
but the following is not an acceptable tiling, because it violates the "no four corners meeting at a point" rule:
Let $F(n)$ be the number of ways the $2\times n$ rectangle can be tiled subject to these rules. Where reflecting horizontally or vertically would give a different tiling, these tilings are to be counted separately.
For example, $F(2) = 120$, $F(5) = 45876$, and $F(100)\equiv 53275818 \pmod{1\,000\,004\,321}$.

Question: A certain type of flexible tile comes in three different sizes - $1 \times 1$, $1 \times 2$, and $1 \times 3$ - and in $k$ different colours. There is an unlimited number of tiles available in each combination of size and colour.
These are used to tile a closed loop of width $2$ and length (circumference) $n$, where $n$ is a positive integer, subject to the following conditions:
For example, the following is an acceptable tiling of a $2\times 23$ loop with $k=4$ (blue, green, red and yellow):
but the following is not an acceptable tiling, because it violates the "no four corners meeting at a point" rule:
Let $F_k(n)$ be the number of ways the $2\times n$ loop can be tiled subject to these rules when $k$ colours are available. (Not all $k$ colours have to be used.) Where reflecting horizontally or vertically would give a different tiling, these tilings are to be counted separately.
For example, $F_4(3) = 104$, $F_5(7) = 3327300$, and $F_6(101)\equiv 75309980 \pmod{1\,000\,004\,321}$.

Title: Beds and Desks
Problem 673
Question: At Euler University, each of the $n$ students (numbered from 1 to $n$) occupies a bed in the dormitory and uses a desk in the classroom.
Some of the beds are in private rooms which a student occupies alone, while the others are in double rooms occupied by two students as roommates. Similarly, each desk is either a single desk for the sole use of one student, or a twin desk at which two students sit together as desk partners.
We represent the bed and desk sharing arrangements each by a list of pairs of student numbers. For example, with $n=4$, if $(2,3)$ represents the bed pairing and $(1,3)(2,4)$ the desk pairing, then students 2 and 3 are roommates while 1 and 4 have single rooms, and students 1 and 3 are desk partners, as are students 2 and 4.
The new chancellor of the university decides to change the organisation of beds and desks: a permutation $\sigma$ of the numbers $1,2,\ldots,n$ will be chosen, and each student $k$ will be given both the bed and the desk formerly occupied by student number $\sigma(k)$.
The students agree to this change, under the conditions that:
In the example above, there are only two ways to satisfy these conditions: either take no action ($\sigma$ is the identity permutation), or reverse the order of the students.
With $n=6$, for the bed pairing $(1,2)(3,4)(5,6)$ and the desk pairing $(3,6)(4,5)$, there are 8 permutations which satisfy the conditions. One example is the mapping $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) \mapsto (1, 2, 5, 6, 3, 4)$.
With $n=36$, if we have bed pairing:
$(2,13)(4,30)(5,27)(6,16)(10,18)(12,35)(14,19)(15,20)(17,26)(21,32)(22,33)(24,34)(25,28)$
and desk pairing
$(1,35)(2,22)(3,36)(4,28)(5,25)(7,18)(9,23)(13,19)(14,33)(15,34)(20,24)(26,29)(27,30)$
then among the $36!$ possible permutations (including the identity permutation), 663552 of them satisfy the conditions stipulated by the students.
The downloadable text files beds.txt and desks.txt contain pairings for $n=500$. Each pairing is written on its own line, with the student numbers of the two roommates (or desk partners) separated with a comma. For example, the desk pairing in the $n=4$ example above would be represented in this file format as:
With these pairings, find the number of permutations that satisfy the students' conditions. Give your answer modulo $999\,999\,937$.

Title: Solving $\mathcal{I}$-equations
Problem 674
Question: We define the $\mathcal{I}$ operator as the function
\[\mathcal{I}(x,y) = (1+x+y)^2+y-x\]
and $\mathcal{I}$-expressions as arithmetic expressions built only from variable names and applications of $\mathcal{I}$. A variable name may consist of one or more letters. For example, the three expressions $x$, $\mathcal{I}(x,y)$, and $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{I}(x,ab),x)$ are all $\mathcal{I}$-expressions.
For two $\mathcal{I}$-expressions $e_1$ and $e_2$ such that the equation $e_1=e_2$ has a solution in non-negative integers, we define the least simultaneous value of $e_1$ and $e_2$ to be the minimum value taken by $e_1$ and $e_2$ on such a solution. If the equation $e_1=e_2$ has no solution in non-negative integers, we define the least simultaneous value of $e_1$ and $e_2$ to be $0$. For example, consider the following three $\mathcal{I}$-expressions:
\[\begin{array}{l}A = \mathcal{I}(x,\mathcal{I}(z,t))\\
B = \mathcal{I}(\mathcal{I}(y,z),y)\\
C = \mathcal{I}(\mathcal{I}(x,z),y)\end{array}\]
The least simultaneous value of $A$ and $B$ is $23$, attained for $x=3,y=1,z=t=0$. On the other hand, $A=C$ has no solutions in non-negative integers, so the least simultaneous value of $A$ and $C$ is $0$. The total sum of least simultaneous pairs made of $\mathcal{I}$-expressions from $\{A,B,C\}$ is $26$.
Find the sum of least simultaneous values of all $\mathcal{I}$-expressions pairs made of distinct expressions from file I-expressions.txt (pairs $(e_1,e_2)$ and $(e_2,e_1)$ are considered to be identical). Give the last nine digits of the result as the answer.

Question: Let $N$ and $K$ be two positive integers.
$F_n$ is the $n$-th Fibonacci number: $F_1 = F_2 = 1$, $F_n = F_{n - 1} + F_{n - 2}$ for all $n \geq 3$.
Let $s_n = F_{2n - 1} \bmod N$ and let $t_n = F_{2n} \bmod N$.
Start with an array of integers $A = (A[0], \cdots, A[N - 1])$ where initially every $A\text{[}i]$ is equal to $i$.
Now perform $K$ successive operations on $A$, where the $j$-th operation consists of reversing the order of those elements in $A$ with indices between $s_j$ and $t_j$ (both ends inclusive).
Define $R(N,K)$ to be $\sum_{i = 0}^{N - 1}i \times A\text {[}i]$ after $K$ operations.
For example, $R(5, 4) = 27$, as can be seen from the following procedure:
Initial position: $(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)$
Step 1 - Reverse $A[1]$ to $A[1]$: $(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)$
Step 2 - Reverse $A[2]$ to $A[3]$: $(0, 1, 3, 2, 4)$
Step 3 - Reverse $A[0]$ to $A[3]$: $(2, 3, 1, 0, 4)$
Step 4 - Reverse $A[3]$ to $A[1]$: $(2, 0, 1, 3, 4)$
$R(5, 4) = 0 \times 2 + 1 \times 0 + 2 \times 1 + 3 \times 3 + 4 \times 4 = 27$
Also, $R(10^2, 10^2) = 246597$ and $R(10^4, 10^4) = 249275481640$.

Title: $5$-Smooth Pairs
Problem 682
Question: $5$-smooth numbers are numbers whose largest prime factor doesn't exceed $5$.
$5$-smooth numbers are also called Hamming numbers.
Let $\Omega(a)$ be the count of prime factors of $a$ (counted with multiplicity).
Let $s(a)$ be the sum of the prime factors of $a$ (with multiplicity).
For example, $\Omega(300) = 5$ and $s(300) = 2+2+3+5+5 = 17$.
Let $f(n)$ be the number of pairs, $(p,q)$, of Hamming numbers such that $\Omega(p)=\Omega(q)$ and $s(p)+s(q)=n$.
You are given $f(10)=4$ (the pairs are $(4,9),(5,5),(6,6),(9,4)$) and $f(10^2)=3629$.
Find $f(10^7) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007$.

Title: The Chase II
Problem 683
Question: Consider the following variant of "The Chase" game. This game is played between $n$ players sitting around a circular table using two dice. It consists of $n-1$ rounds, and at the end of each round one player is eliminated and has to pay a certain amount of money into a pot. The last player remaining is the winner and receives the entire contents of the pot.
At the beginning of a round, each die is given to a randomly selected player. A round then consists of a number of turns.
During each turn, each of the two players with a die rolls it. If a player rolls a 1 or a 2, the die is passed to the neighbour on the left; if the player rolls a 5 or a 6, the die is passed to the neighbour on the right; otherwise, the player keeps the die for the next turn.
The round ends when one player has both dice at the beginning of a turn. At which point that player is immediately eliminated and has to pay $s^2$ where $s$ is the number of completed turns in this round. Note that if both dice happen to be handed to the same player at the beginning of a round, then no turns are completed, so the player is eliminated without having to pay any money into the pot.
Let $G(n)$ be the expected amount that the winner will receive. For example $G(5)$ is approximately 96.544, and $G(50)$ is 2.82491788e6 in scientific notation rounded to 9 significant digits.
Find $G(500)$, giving your answer in scientific notation rounded to 9 significant digits.

Title: Shuffling Cards
Problem 687
Question: A standard deck of $52$ playing cards, which consists of thirteen ranks (Ace, Two, ..., Ten, King, Queen and Jack) each in four suits (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades), is randomly shuffled.  Let us call a rank perfect if no two cards of that same rank appear next to each other after the shuffle.

It can be seen that the expected number of ranks that are perfect after a random shuffle equals $\frac {4324} {425} \approx 10.1741176471$.

Find the probability that the number of perfect ranks is prime. Give your answer rounded to $10$ decimal places.

Title: Piles of Plates
Problem 688
Question: 
We stack $n$ plates into $k$ non-empty piles where each pile is a different size. Define $f(n,k)$ to be the maximum number of plates possible in the smallest pile. For example when $n = 10$ and $k = 3$ the piles $2,3,5$ is the best that can be done and so $f(10,3) = 2$. It is impossible to divide 10 into 5 non-empty differently-sized piles and hence $f(10,5) = 0$.


Define $F(n)$ to be the sum of $f(n,k)$ for all possible pile sizes $k\ge 1$. For example $F(100) = 275$.


Further define $S(N) = \displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^N F(n)$. You are given $S(100) = 12656$.

Title: Tom and Jerry
Problem 690
Question: 
Tom (the cat) and Jerry (the mouse) are playing on a simple graph $G$.


Every vertex of $G$ is a mousehole, and every edge of $G$ is a tunnel connecting two mouseholes.


Originally, Jerry is hiding in one of the mouseholes.
Every morning, Tom can check one (and only one) of the mouseholes. If Jerry happens to be hiding there then Tom catches Jerry and the game is over.
Every evening, if the game continues, Jerry moves to a mousehole which is adjacent (i.e. connected by a tunnel, if there is one available) to his current hiding place. The next morning Tom checks again and the game continues like this.


Let us call a graph $G$ a Tom graph, if our super-smart Tom, who knows the configuration of the graph but does not know the location of Jerry, can guarantee to catch Jerry in finitely many days.
For example consider all graphs on 3 nodes:


For graphs 1 and 2, Tom will catch Jerry in at most three days. For graph 3 Tom can check the middle connection on two consecutive days and hence guarantee to catch Jerry in at most two days. These three graphs are therefore Tom Graphs. However, graph 4 is not a Tom Graph because the game could potentially continue forever.


Let $T(n)$ be the number of different Tom graphs with $n$ vertices. Two graphs are considered the same if there is a bijection $f$ between their vertices, such that $(v,w)$ is an edge if and only if $(f(v),f(w))$ is an edge.


We have $T(3) = 3$, $T(7) = 37$, $T(10) = 328$ and $T(20) = 1416269$.


Find $T(2019)$ giving your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.

Problem 691
Question: Given a character string $s$, we define $L(k,s)$ to be the length of the longest substring of $s$ which appears at least $k$ times in $s$, or $0$ if such a substring does not exist. For example, $L(3,\text{“bbabcabcabcacba”})=4$ because of the three occurrences of the substring $\text{“abca”}$, and $L(2,\text{“bbabcabcabcacba”})=7$ because of the repeated substring $\text{“abcabca”}$. Note that the occurrences can overlap.
Let $a_n$, $b_n$ and $c_n$ be the $0/1$ sequences defined by:
and $S_n$ the character string $c_0\ldots c_{n-1}$. You are given that $L(2,S_{10})=5$, $L(3,S_{10})=2$, $L(2,S_{100})=14$, $L(4,S_{100})=6$, $L(2,S_{1000})=86$, $L(3,S_{1000}) = 45$, $L(5,S_{1000}) = 31$, and that the sum of non-zero $L(k,S_{1000})$ for $k\ge 1$ is $2460$.

Title: Siegbert and Jo
Problem 692
Question: 
Siegbert and Jo take turns playing a game with a heap of $N$ pebbles:
1. Siegbert is the first to take some pebbles. He can take as many pebbles as he wants. (Between 1 and $N$ inclusive.)
2. In each of the following turns the current player must take at least one pebble and at most twice the amount of pebbles taken by the previous player.
3. The player who takes the last pebble wins.

Although Siegbert can always win by taking all the pebbles on his first turn, to make the game more interesting he chooses to take the smallest number of pebbles that guarantees he will still win (assuming both Siegbert and Jo play optimally for the rest of the game).


Let $H(N)$ be that minimal amount for a heap of $N$ pebbles.
$H(1)=1$, $H(4)=1$, $H(17)=1$, $H(8)=8$ and $H(18)=5$ .


Let $G(n)$ be $\displaystyle{\sum_{k=1}^n H(k)}$.

Title: Finite Sequence Generator
Problem 693
Question: Two positive integers $x$ and $y$ ($x > y$) can generate a sequence in the following manner:
The number of terms in this sequence is denoted $l(x,y)$.
For example, with $x = 5$ and $y = 3$, we get $a_5 = 3$, $a_6 = 3^2 \bmod 5 = 4$, $a_7 = 4^2\bmod 6 = 4$, etc. Giving the sequence of 29 terms:
$	3,4,4,2,4,7,9,4,4,3,9,6,4,16,4,16,16,4,16,3,9,6,10,19,25,16,16,8,0		$
Hence $l(5,3) = 29$.
$g(x)$ is defined  to be the maximum value of $l(x,y)$ for $y \lt x$. For example, $g(5) = 29$.
Further, define $f(n)$ to be the maximum value of $g(x)$ for $x \le n$. For example, $f(100) = 145$ and $f(10\,000) = 8824$.
Find $f(3\,000\,000)$.

Title: Mahjong
Problem 696
Question: The game of Mahjong is played with tiles belonging to $s$ suits. Each tile also has a number in the range $1\ldots n$, and for each suit/number combination there are exactly four indistinguishable tiles with that suit and number. (The real Mahjong game also contains other bonus tiles, but those will not feature in this problem.)
A winning hand is a collection of $3t+2$ Tiles (where $t$ is a fixed integer) that can be arranged as $t$ Triples and one Pair, where:
For example, here is a winning hand with $n=9$, $s=3$, $t=4$, consisting in this case of two Chows, two Pungs, and one Pair:
Note that sometimes the same collection of tiles can be represented as $t$ Triples and one Pair in more than one way. This only counts as one winning hand. For example, this is considered to be the same winning hand as above, because it consists of the same tiles:
Let $w(n, s, t)$ be the number of distinct winning hands formed of $t$ Triples and one Pair, where there are $s$ suits available and tiles are numbered up to $n$.
For example, with a single suit and tiles numbered up to $4$, we have $w(4, 1, 1) = 20$: there are $12$ winning hands consisting of a Pung and a Pair, and another $8$ containing a Chow and a Pair. You are also given that $w(9, 1, 4) = 13259$, $w(9, 3, 4) = 5237550$, and $w(1000, 1000, 5) \equiv 107662178 \pmod{1\,000\,000\,007}$.
Find $w(10^8, 10^8, 30)$. Give your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.

So 2 is a 123-number, since it consists of one  digit "2" and 1 is a 123-number. Therefore, 33 is a 123-number as well since it consists of two digits "3" and 2 is a 123-number.
On the other hand, 1111 is not a 123-number, since it contains 4 digits "1" and 4 is not a 123-number.


In ascending order, the first 123-numbers are:
$1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 31, 32, 33, 111, 112, 113, 121, 122, 123, 131, \ldots$


Let $F(n)$ be the $n$-th 123-number. For example $F(4)=11$, $F(10)=31$, $F(40)=1112$, $F(1000)=1223321$ and $F(6000)= 2333333333323$.

Question: Leonhard Euler was born on 15 April 1707.
Consider the sequence 1504170715041707n mod 4503599627370517.
An element of this sequence is defined to be an Eulercoin if it is strictly smaller than all previously found Eulercoins.
For example, the first term is 1504170715041707 which is the first Eulercoin.  The second term is 3008341430083414 which is greater than 1504170715041707 so is not an Eulercoin.  However, the third term is 8912517754604 which is small enough to be a new Eulercoin.
The sum of the first 2 Eulercoins is therefore 1513083232796311.

Title: Jumping Flea
Problem 702
Question: A regular hexagon table of side length $N$ is divided into equilateral triangles of side length $1$. The picture below is an illustration of the case $N = 3$.
An flea of negligible size is jumping on this table. The flea starts at the centre of the table. Thereafter, at each step, it chooses one of the six corners of the table, and jumps to the mid-point between its current position and the chosen corner.
For every triangle $T$, we denote by $J(T)$ the minimum number of jumps required for the flea to reach the interior of $T$. Landing on an edge or vertex of $T$ is not sufficient.
For example, $J(T) = 3$ for the triangle marked with a star in the picture: by jumping from the centre half way towards F, then towards C, then towards E.
Let $S(N)$ be the sum of $J(T)$ for all the upper-pointing triangles $T$ in the upper half of the table. For the case $N = 3$, these are the triangles painted black in the above picture.
You are given that $S(3) = 42$, $S(5) = 126$, $S(123) = 167178$, and $S(12345) = 3185041956$.

Title: Total Inversion Count of Divided Sequences
Problem 705
Question: 
The inversion count of a sequence of digits is the smallest number of adjacent pairs that must be swapped to sort the sequence.

$34214 \to 32414 \to 23414 \to 23144 \to 21344 \to12344$.


If each digit of a sequence is replaced by one of its divisors a divided sequence is obtained.

Define $G(N)$ to be the concatenation of all primes less than $N$, ignoring any zero digit. 
For example, $G(20) = 235711131719$.


Define $F(N)$ to be the sum of the inversion count for all possible divided sequences from the master sequence $G(N)$. 
You are given $F(20) = 3312$ and $F(50) = 338079744$.

For a positive integer $n$, define $f(n)$ to be the number of non-empty substrings of $n$ that are divisible by $3$. For example, the string "2573" has $10$ non-empty substrings, three of which represent numbers that are divisible by $3$, namely $57$, $573$ and $3$. So $f(2573) = 3$.


If $f(n)$ is divisible by $3$ then we say that $n$ is $3$-like.


Define $F(d)$ to be how many $d$ digit numbers are $3$-like. For example, $F(2) = 30$ and $F(6) = 290898$.


Find $F(10^5)$. Give your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.

Title: Lights Out
Problem 707
Question: 
Consider a $w\times h$ grid. A cell is either ON or OFF. When a cell is selected, that cell and all cells connected to that cell by an edge are toggled on-off, off-on. See the diagram for the 3 cases of selecting a corner cell, an edge cell or central cell in a grid that has all cells on (white).

The goal is to get every cell to be off simultaneously. This is not possible for all starting states. A state is solvable if, by a process of selecting cells, the goal can be achieved.


Let $F(w,h)$ be the number of solvable states for a $w\times h$ grid. 
You are given $F(1,2)=2$, $F(3,3) = 512$, $F(4,4) = 4096$ and $F(7,11) \equiv 270016253 \pmod{1\,000\,000\,007}$.

Title: Twos Are All You Need
Problem 708
Question: A positive integer, $n$, is factorised into prime factors. We define $f(n)$ to be the product when each prime factor is replaced with $2$. In addition we define $f(1)=1$.
For example, $90 = 2\times 3\times 3\times 5$, then replacing the primes, $2\times 2\times 2\times 2 = 16$, hence $f(90) = 16$.
Let $\displaystyle S(N)=\sum_{n=1}^{N} f(n)$. You are given $S(10^8)=9613563919$.

Title: Even Stevens
Problem 709
Question: Every day for the past $n$ days Even Stevens brings home his groceries in a plastic bag. He stores these plastic bags in a cupboard. He either puts the plastic bag into the cupboard with the rest, or else he takes an even number of the existing bags (which may either be empty or previously filled with other bags themselves) and places these into the current bag.
After 4 days there are 5 possible packings and if the bags are numbered 1 (oldest), 2, 3, 4, they are:
Note that 1, 2, 3 inside 4 is invalid because every bag must contain an even number of bags.
Define $f(n)$ to be the number of possible packings of $n$ bags. Hence $f(4)=5$. You are also given $f(8)=1\,385$.
Find $f(24\,680)$ giving your answer modulo $1\,020\,202\,009$.

Title: One Million Members
Problem 710
Question: The number 6 can be written as a palindromic sum in exactly eight different ways:
We shall define a twopal to be a palindromic tuple having at least one element with a value of 2. It should also be noted that elements are not restricted to single digits. For example, $(3, 2, 13, 6, 13, 2, 3)$ is a valid twopal.
If we let $t(n)$ be the number of twopals whose elements sum to $n$, then it can be seen that $t(6) = 4$:
Similarly, $t(20) = 824$.
In searching for the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything, it can be verified that $t(42) = 1999923$, which happens to be the first value of $t(n)$ that exceeds one million.
However, your challenge to the "ultimatest" question of life, the universe, and everything is to find the least value of $n \gt 42$ such that $t(n)$ is divisible by one million.

Title: Binary Blackboard
Problem 711
Question: Oscar and Eric play the following game. First, they agree on a positive integer $n$, and they begin by writing its binary representation on a blackboard. They then take turns, with Oscar going first, to write a number on the blackboard in binary representation, such that the sum of all written numbers does not exceed $2n$.
The game ends when there are no valid moves left. Oscar wins if the number of $1$s on the blackboard is odd, and Eric wins if it is even.
Let $S(N)$ be the sum of all $n \le 2^N$ for which Eric can guarantee winning, assuming optimal play.
For example, the first few values of $n$ for which Eric can guarantee winning are $1,3,4,7,15,16$. Hence $S(4)=46$.

Title: Turán's Water Heating System
Problem 713
Question: 
Turan has the electrical water heating system outside his house in a shed. The electrical system uses two fuses in series, one in the house and one in the shed. (Nowadays old fashioned fuses are often replaced with reusable mini circuit breakers, but Turan's system still uses old fashioned fuses.)
For the heating system to work both fuses must work.


Turan has $N$ fuses. He knows that $m$ of them are working and the rest are blown. However, he doesn't know which ones are blown. So he tries different combinations until the heating system turns on.
We denote by $T(N,m)$ the smallest number of tries required to ensure the heating system turns on.
$T(3,2)=3$ and $T(8,4)=7$.


Let $L(N)$ be the sum of all $T(N, m)$ for $2 \leq m \leq N$.

Question: We call a natural number a duodigit if its decimal representation uses no more than two different digits.

It can be shown that every natural number has duodigit multiples. Let $d(n)$ be the smallest (positive) multiple of the number $n$ that happens to be a duodigit. For example, $d(12)=12$, $d(102)=1122$, $d(103)=515$, $d(290)=11011010$ and $d(317)=211122$.

Title: Grid Graphs
Problem 716
Question: 
Consider a directed graph made from an orthogonal lattice of $H\times W$ nodes. 
The edges are the horizontal and vertical connections between adjacent nodes.
$W$ vertical directed lines are drawn and all the edges on these lines inherit that direction. Similarly, $H$ horizontal directed lines are drawn and all the edges on these lines inherit that direction.


Two nodes, $A$ and $B$ in a directed graph, are strongly connected if there is both a path, along the directed edges, from $A$ to $B$ as well as from $B$ to $A$. Note that every node is strongly connected to itself.


A strongly connected component in a directed graph is a non-empty set $M$ of nodes satisfying the following two properties:


There are $2^H\times 2^W$ ways of drawing the directed lines. Each way gives a directed graph $\mathcal{G}$. We define $S(\mathcal{G})$ to be the number of strongly connected components in $\mathcal{G}$.


The illustration below shows a directed graph with $H=3$ and $W=4$ that consists of four different strongly connected components (indicated by the different colours).


Define $C(H,W)$ to be the sum of $S(\mathcal{G})$ for all possible graphs on a grid of $H\times W$. You are given $C(3,3) = 408$, $C(3,6) = 4696$ and $C(10,20) \equiv 988971143 \pmod{1\,000\,000\,007}$.

We define an $S$-number to be a natural number, $n$, that is a perfect square and its square root can be obtained by splitting the decimal representation of $n$ into $2$ or more numbers then adding the numbers.


For example, $81$ is an $S$-number because $\sqrt{81} = 8+1$.

$8281$ is an $S$-number: $\sqrt{8281} = 8+2+81 = 82+8+1$.
$9801$ is an $S$-number: $\sqrt{9801}=98+0+1$.


Further we define $T(N)$ to be the sum of all $S$ numbers $n\le N$. You are given $T(10^4) = 41333$.

Question: Consider all permutations of $\{1, 2, \ldots N\}$, listed in lexicographic order.For example, for $N=4$, the list starts as follows:

Let us call a permutation $P$ unpredictable if there is no choice of three indices $i \lt j \lt k$ such that $P(i)$, $P(j)$ and $P(k)$ constitute an arithmetic progression. For example, $P=(3, 4, 2, 1)$ is not unpredictable because $P(1), P(3), P(4)$ is an arithmetic progression.


Let $S(N)$ be the position within the list of the first unpredictable permutation.


For example, given $N = 4$, the first unpredictable permutation is $(1, 3, 2, 4)$ so $S(4) = 3$.
You are also given that $S(8) = 2295$ and $S(32) \equiv 641839205 \pmod{1\,000\,000\,007}$.

Title: Pythagorean Quadrilaterals
Problem 723
Question: A pythagorean triangle with catheti $a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse $c$ is characterized by the well-known equation $a^2+b^2=c^2$. However, this can also be formulated differently:
When inscribed into a circle with radius $r$, a triangle with sides $a$, $b$ and $c$ is pythagorean, if and only if $a^2+b^2+c^2=8\, r^2$.
Analogously, we call a quadrilateral $ABCD$ with sides $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$, inscribed in a circle with radius $r$, a pythagorean quadrilateral, if $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2=8\, r^2$. 
We further call a pythagorean quadrilateral a pythagorean lattice grid quadrilateral, if all four vertices are lattice grid points with the same distance $r$ from the origin $O$ (which then happens to be the centre of the circumcircle).

Let $f(r)$ be the number of different pythagorean lattice grid quadrilaterals for which the radius of the circumcircle is $r$. For example $f(1)=1$, $f(\sqrt 2)=1$, $f(\sqrt 5)=38$ and $f(5)=167$. 
Two of the pythagorean lattice grid  quadrilaterals with $r=\sqrt 5$ are illustrated below:

Let $\displaystyle S(n)=\sum_{d \mid n} f(\sqrt d)$. For example, $S(325)=S(5^2 \cdot 13)=f(1)+f(\sqrt 5)+f(5)+f(\sqrt {13})+f(\sqrt{65})+f(5\sqrt{13})=2370$ and $S(1105)=S(5\cdot 13 \cdot 17)=5535$.

Find $S(1411033124176203125)=S(5^6 \cdot 13^3 \cdot 17^2 \cdot 29 \cdot 37 \cdot 41 \cdot 53 \cdot 61)$.

Question: A depot uses $n$ drones to disperse packages containing essential supplies along a long straight road.
Initially all drones are stationary, loaded with a supply package.
Every second, the depot selects a drone at random and sends it this instruction:
The road is wide enough that drones can overtake one another without risk of collision.
Eventually, there will only be one drone left at the depot waiting to receive its first instruction. As soon as that drone has flown one centimetre along the road, all drones drop their packages and return to the depot.
Let $E(n)$ be the expected distance in centimetres from the depot that the supply packages land.
For example, $E(2) = \frac{7}{2}$, $E(5) = \frac{12019}{720}$, and $E(100) \approx 1427.193470$.

Title: Falling Bottles
Problem 726
Question: 
Consider a stack of bottles of wine. There are $n$ layers in the stack with the top layer containing only one bottle and the bottom layer containing $n$ bottles. For $n=4$ the stack looks like the picture below.


The collapsing process happens every time a bottle is taken. A space is created in the stack and that space is filled according to the following recursive steps:


This process happens recursively; for example, taking bottle $A$ in the diagram above. Its place can be filled with either $B$ or $C$. If it is filled with $C$ then the space that $C$ creates can be filled with $D$ or $E$. So there are 3 different collapsing processes that can happen if $A$ is taken, although the final shape (in this case) is the same.


Define $f(n)$ to be the number of ways that we can take all the bottles from a stack with $n$ layers. 
Two ways are considered different if at any step we took a different bottle or the collapsing process went differently.


You are given $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 6$ and $f(3) = 1008$.

Title: Circle of Coins
Problem 728
Question: Consider $n$ coins arranged in a circle where each coin shows heads or tails. A move consists of turning over $k$ consecutive coins: tail-head or head-tail. Using a sequence of these moves the objective is to get all the coins showing heads.
Consider the example, shown below, where $n=8$ and $k=3$ and the initial state is one coin showing tails (black). The example shows a solution for this state.
For given values of $n$ and $k$ not all states are solvable.  Let $F(n,k)$ be the number of states that are solvable. You are given that $F(3,2) = 4$, $F(8,3) = 256$ and $F(9,3) = 128$.

Title: Range of Periodic Sequence
Problem 729
Question: Consider the sequence of real numbers $a_n$ defined by the starting value $a_0$ and the recurrence
$\displaystyle a_{n+1}=a_n-\frac 1 {a_n}$ for any $n  \ge 0$.

For some starting values $a_0$ the sequence will be periodic. For example, $a_0=\sqrt{\frac 1 2}$ yields the sequence:
$\sqrt{\frac 1 2},-\sqrt{\frac 1 2},\sqrt{\frac 1 2}, \dots$

We are interested in the range of such a periodic sequence which is the difference between the maximum and minimum of the sequence. For example, the range of the sequence above would be $\sqrt{\frac 1 2}-(-\sqrt{\frac 1 2})=\sqrt{ 2}$.

Let $S(P)$ be the sum of the ranges of all such periodic sequences with a period not exceeding $P$.
For example, $S(2)=2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.8284$, being the sum of the ranges of the two sequences starting with $a_0=\sqrt{\frac 1 2}$ and $a_0=-\sqrt{\frac 1 2}$. 
You are given $S(3) \approx 14.6461$ and $S(5) \approx 124.1056$.

Title: Standing on the Shoulders of Trolls
Problem 732
Question: 
$N$ trolls are in a hole that is $D_N$ cm deep. The $n$-th troll is characterized by:


Trolls can pile up on top of each other, with each troll standing on the shoulders of the one below him. A troll can climb out of the hole and escape if his hands can reach to the surface. Once a troll escapes he cannot participate any further in the escaping effort.


The trolls execute an optimal strategy for maximizing the total IQ of the escaping trolls, defined as $Q(N)$.


Let
$r_n = \left[ \left( 5^n \bmod (10^9 + 7) \right) \bmod 101 \right] + 50$

$h_n = r_{3n}$

$l_n = r_{3n+1}$

$q_n = r_{3n+2}$

$D_N = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} h_n$.


For example, the first troll ($n=0$) is 51cm tall to his shoulders, has 55cm long arms, and has an IQ of 75.


You are given that $Q(5) = 401$ and $Q(15)=941$.

Title: Coin Loops
Problem 737
Question: 
A game is played with many identical, round coins on a flat table.


Consider a line perpendicular to the table.
The first coin is placed on the table touching the line.
Then, one by one, the coins are placed horizontally on top of the previous coin and touching the line.
The complete stack of coins must be balanced after every placement.


The diagram below [not to scale] shows a possible placement of 8 coins where point $P$ represents the line.


It is found that a minimum of $31$ coins are needed to form a coin loop around the line, i.e. if in the projection of the coins on the table the centre of the $n$th coin is rotated $\theta_n$, about the line, from the centre of the $(n-1)$th coin then the sum of $\displaystyle\sum_{k=2}^n \theta_k$ is first larger than $360^\circ$ when $n=31$. In general, to loop $k$ times, $n$ is the smallest number for which the sum is greater than $360^\circ k$.


Also, $154$ coins are needed to loop two times around the line, and $6947$ coins to loop ten times.


Calculate the number of coins needed to loop $2020$ times around the line.

Title: Summation of Summations
Problem 739
Question: 
Take a sequence of length $n$. Discard the first term then make a sequence of the partial summations. Continue to do this over and over until we are left with a single term. We define this to be $f(n)$.


Consider the example where we start with a sequence of length 8:


$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
1&1&1&1&1&1&1&1\\
 &1&2&3&4&5& 6 &7\\
 & &2&5&9&14&20&27\\
 & & &5&14&28&48&75\\
 & & & &14&42&90&165\\
 & & & & & 42 & 132 & 297\\
 & & & & & & 132 &429\\
 & & & & & & &429\\
\end{array}
$


Then the final number is $429$, so $f(8) = 429$.


For this problem we start with the sequence $1,3,4,7,11,18,29,47,\ldots$
This is the Lucas sequence where two terms are added to get the next term. 
Applying the same process as above we get $f(8) = 2663$.
You are also given $f(20) = 742296999 $ modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$


Find $f(10^8)$. Give your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.

Title: Secret Santa
Problem 740
Question: 
Secret Santa is a process that allows $n$ people to give each other presents, so that each person gives a single present and receives a single present. At the beginning each of the $n$ people write their name on a slip of paper and put the slip into a hat. Each person takes a random slip from the hat. If the slip has their name they draw another random slip from the hat and then put the slip with their name back into the hat. At the end everyone buys a Christmas present for the person whose name is on the slip they are holding. This process will fail if the last person draws their own name.


In this variation each of the $n$ people gives and receives two presents. At the beginning each of the $n$ people writes their name on two slips of paper and puts the slips into a hat (there will be $2n$ slips of paper in the hat). As before each person takes from the hat a random slip that does not contain their own name. Then the same person repeats this process thus ending up with two slips, neither of which contains that person's own name. Then the next person draws two slips in the same way, and so on. The process will fail if the last person gets at least one slip with their own name. 


Define $q(n)$ to be the probability of this happening. You are given $q(3) = 0.3611111111$ and $q(5) = 0.2476095994$ both rounded to 10 decimal places.

Title: What? Where? When?
Problem 744
Question: "What? Where? When?" is a TV game show in which a team of experts attempt to answer questions. The following is a simplified version of the game.
It begins with $2n+1$ envelopes. $2n$ of them contain a question and one contains a RED card.
In each round one of the remaining envelopes is randomly chosen. If the envelope contains the RED card the game ends. If the envelope contains a question the expert gives their answer. If their answer is correct they earn one point, otherwise the viewers earn one point. The game ends normally when either the expert obtains n points or the viewers obtain n points.
Assuming that the expert provides the correct answer with a fixed probability $p$, let $f(n,p)$ be the probability that the game ends normally (i.e. RED card never turns up).
You are given (rounded to 10 decimal places) that

A solution $(x,y,z)$  to this equation with $x,y$ and $z$ positive integers is a primitive solution if $\gcd(x,y,z)=1$.

Title: Optimal Card Stacking
Problem 750
Question: 
Card Stacking is a game on a computer starting with an array of $N$ cards labelled $1,2,\ldots,N$.
A stack of cards can be moved by dragging horizontally with the mouse to another stack but only when the resulting stack is in sequence. The goal of the game is to combine the cards into a single stack using minimal total drag distance.


For the given arrangement of 6 cards the minimum total distance is $1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 8$.


For $N$ cards, the cards are arranged so that the card at position $n$ is $3^n\bmod(N+1), 1\le n\le N$.


We define $G(N)$ to be the minimal total drag distance to arrange these cards into a single sequence.
For example, when $N = 6$ we get the sequence $3,2,6,4,5,1$ and $G(6) = 8$.
You are given $G(16) = 47$.


Find $G(976)$.

Title: Concatenation Coincidence
Problem 751
Question: A non-decreasing sequence of integers $a_n$ can be generated from any positive real value $\theta$ by the following procedure:
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
b_1 &= \theta \\
b_n &= \left\lfloor b_{n-1} \right\rfloor \left(b_{n-1} - \left\lfloor b_{n-1} \right\rfloor + 1\right)~~~\forall ~ n \geq 2 \\
a_n &= \left\lfloor b_{n} \right\rfloor
\end{split}
\end{align}
Where $\left\lfloor \cdot \right\rfloor$ is the floor function.
For example, $\theta=2.956938891377988...$ generates the Fibonacci sequence: $2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...$
The concatenation of a sequence of positive integers $a_n$ is a real value denoted $\tau$ constructed by concatenating the elements of the sequence after the decimal point, starting at $a_1$: $a_1.a_2a_3a_4...$
For example, the Fibonacci sequence constructed from $\theta=2.956938891377988...$ yields the concatenation $\tau=2.3581321345589...$ Clearly, $\tau \neq \theta$ for this value of $\theta$.
Find the only value of $\theta$ for which the generated sequence starts at $a_1=2$ and the concatenation of the generated sequence equals the original value: $\tau = \theta$. Give your answer rounded to $24$ places after the decimal point.

Title: Approximating a Sum
Problem 756
Question: Consider a function $f(k)$ defined for all positive integers $k>0$. Let $S$ be the sum of the first $n$ values of $f$. That is,
$$S=f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+\cdots+f(n)=\sum_{k=1}^n f(k).$$
In this problem, we employ randomness to approximate this sum. That is, we choose a random, uniformly distributed, $m$-tuple of positive integers $(X_1,X_2,X_3,\cdots,X_m)$ such that $0=X_0 \lt X_1 \lt X_2 \lt \cdots \lt X_m \leq n$ and calculate a modified sum $S^*$ as follows.
$$S^* = \sum_{i=1}^m f(X_i)(X_i-X_{i-1})$$
We now define the error of this approximation to be $\Delta=S-S^*$.
Let $\mathbb{E}(\Delta|f(k),n,m)$ be the expected value of the error given the function $f(k)$, the number of terms $n$ in the sum and the length of random sample $m$.
For example, $\mathbb{E}(\Delta|k,100,50) = 2525/1326 \approx 1.904223$ and $\mathbb{E}(\Delta|\varphi(k),10^4,10^2)\approx 5842.849907$, where $\varphi(k)$ is Euler's totient function.
Find $\mathbb{E}(\Delta|\varphi(k),12345678,12345)$ rounded to six places after the decimal point.

Title: Buckets of Water
Problem 758
Question: 
There are 3 buckets labelled $S$ (small) of 3 litres, $M$ (medium) of 5 litres and $L$ (large) of 8 litres.
Initially $S$ and $M$ are full of water and $L$ is empty.
By pouring water between the buckets exactly one litre of water can be measured.
Since there is no other way to measure, once a pouring starts it cannot stop until either the source bucket is empty or the destination bucket is full.
At least four pourings are needed to get one litre:


After these operations, there is exactly one litre in bucket $S$.


In general the sizes of the buckets $S, M, L$ are $a$, $b$, $a + b$ litres, respectively. Initially $S$ and $M$ are full and $L$ is empty. If the above rule of pouring still applies and $a$ and $b$ are two coprime positive integers with $a\leq b$ then it is always possible to measure one litre in finitely many steps.


Let $P(a,b)$ be the minimal number of pourings needed to get one litre. Thus $P(3,5)=4$.
Also, $P(7, 31)=20$ and $P(1234, 4321)=2780$.


Find the sum of $P(2^{p^5}-1, 2^{q^5}-1)$ for all pairs of prime numbers $p,q$ such that $p < q < 1000$.

Title: Runner and Swimmer
Problem 761
Question: Two friends, a runner and a swimmer, are playing a sporting game: The swimmer is swimming within a circular pool while the runner moves along the pool edge.
While the runner tries to catch the swimmer at the very moment that the swimmer leaves the pool, the swimmer tries to reach the edge before the runner arrives there. They start the game with the swimmer located in the middle of the pool, while the runner is located anywhere at the edge of the pool.
We assume that the swimmer can move with any velocity up to $1$ in any direction and the runner can move with any velocity up to $v$ in either direction around the edge of the pool. Moreover we assume that both players can react immediately to any change of movement of their opponent.
Assuming optimal strategy of both players, it can be shown that the swimmer can always win by escaping the pool at some point at the edge before the runner gets there, if $v$ is less than the critical speed $V_{Circle} \approx 4.60333885$ and can never win if $v>V_{Circle}$.
Now the two players play the game in a perfectly square pool. Again the swimmer starts in the middle of the pool, while the runner starts at the midpoint of one of the edges of the pool. It can be shown that the critical maximal speed of the runner below which the swimmer can always escape and above which the runner can always catch the swimmer when trying to leave the pool is $V_{Square} \approx 5.78859314$.
At last, both players decide to play the game in a pool in the form of regular hexagon. Giving the same conditions as above, with the swimmer starting in the middle of the pool and the runner at the midpoint of one of the edges of the pool, find the critical maximal speed $V_{Hexagon}$ of the runner, below which the swimmer can always escape and above which the runner can always catch the swimmer.

Title: Amoebas in a 2D Grid
Problem 762
Question: Consider a two dimensional grid of squares. The grid has 4 rows but infinitely many columns.
An amoeba in square $(x, y)$ can divide itself into two amoebas to occupy the squares $(x+1,y)$ and $(x+1,(y+1) \bmod 4)$, provided these squares are empty.
The following diagrams show two cases of an amoeba placed in square A of each grid. When it divides, it is replaced with two amoebas, one at each of the squares marked with B:
Originally there is only one amoeba in the square $(0, 0)$. After $N$ divisions there will be $N+1$ amoebas arranged in the grid. An arrangement may be reached in several different ways but it is only counted once. Let $C(N)$ be the number of different possible arrangements after $N$ divisions.
For example, $C(2) = 2$, $C(10) = 1301$, $C(20)=5895236$ and the last nine digits of $C(100)$ are $125923036$.

Question: A sliding block puzzle is a puzzle where pieces are confined to a grid and by sliding the pieces a final configuration is reached. In this problem the pieces can only be slid in multiples of one unit in the directions up, down, left, right.
A reachable configuration is any arrangement of the pieces that can be achieved by sliding the pieces from the initial configuration.
Two configurations are identical if the same shape pieces occupy the same position in the grid. So in the case below the red squares are indistinguishable. For this example the number of reachable configurations is $208$.
Find the number of reachable configurations for the puzzle below. Note that the red L-shaped pieces are considered different from the green L-shaped pieces.

Title: Balanceable $k$-bounded Partitions

Question: A $k$-bounded partition of a positive integer $N$ is a way of writing $N$ as a sum of positive integers not exceeding $k$.
A balanceable partition is a partition that can be further divided into two parts of equal sums.
For example, $3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1$ is a balanceable $3$-bounded partition of $12$ since $3 + 2 + 1 = 2 + 2 + 2$. Conversely, $3 + 3 + 3 + 1$ is a $3$-bounded partition of $10$ which is not balanceable.
Let $f(k)$ be the smallest positive integer $N$ all of whose $k$-bounded partitions are balanceable. For example, $f(3) = 12$ and $f(30) \equiv 179092994 \pmod {1\,000\,000\,007}$.

Title: Saving Paper
Problem 775
Question: When wrapping several cubes in paper, it is more efficient to wrap them all together than to wrap each one individually. For example, with 10 cubes of unit edge length, it would take 30 units of paper to wrap them in the arrangement shown below, but 60 units to wrap them separately.
Define $g(n)$ to be the maximum amount of paper that can be saved by wrapping $n$ identical $1\times 1\times 1$ cubes in a compact arrangement, compared with wrapping them individually. We insist that the wrapping paper is in contact with the cubes at all points, without leaving a void.
With 10 cubes, the arrangement illustrated above is optimal, so $g(10)=60-30=30$. With 18 cubes, it can be shown that the optimal arrangement is as a $3\times 3\times 2$, using 42 units of paper, whereas wrapping individually would use 108 units of paper; hence $g(18) = 66$.
Define
$$G(N) = \sum_{n=1}^N g(n)$$

In other words, when tracing a path on the rectangle, reaching an edge results in "wrapping round" to the corresponding point on the opposite edge.
A tiling of a torus is a way to dissect it into equilateral triangles of edge length 1. For example, the following three diagrams illustrate respectively a $1\times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ torus with two triangles, a $\sqrt{3}\times 1$ torus with four triangles, and an approximately $2.8432\times 2.1322$ torus with fourteen triangles:
Two tilings of an $a\times b$ torus are called equivalent if it is possible to obtain one from the other by continuously moving all triangles so that no gaps appear and no triangles overlap at any stage during the movement. For example, the animation below shows an equivalence between two tilings:
Let $F(n)$ be the total number of non-equivalent tilings of all possible tori with exactly $n$ triangles. For example, $F(6)=8$, with the eight non-equivalent tilings with six triangles listed below:

We let $B_t(n,k)$ be the number of black balls that are removed on turn $t$.

Further define $E(n,k)$ as the expectation of $\displaystyle \sum_{t=1}^n B_t(n,k)^2$.

You are given $E(2,2) = 9.6$.

Title: Reciprocal Pairs
Problem 784
Question: 
Let's call a pair of positive integers $p$, $q$ ($p \lt q$) reciprocal, if there is a positive integer $r\lt p$ such that $r$ equals both the inverse of $p$ modulo $q$ and the inverse of $q$ modulo $p$.

For example, $(3,5)$ is one reciprocal pair for $r=2$.
Let $F(N)$ be the total sum of $p+q$ for all reciprocal pairs $(p,q)$ where $p \le N$.

$F(5)=59$ due to these four reciprocal pairs $(3,5)$, $(4,11)$, $(5,7)$ and $(5,19)$.
You are also given $F(10^2) = 697317$.

Title: Symmetric Diophantine Equation
Problem 785
Question: 
Consider the following Diophantine equation:
$$15  (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 34  (xy + yz + zx)$$
where $x$, $y$ and $z$ are positive integers.


Let $S(N)$ be the sum of all solutions, $(x,y,z)$, of this equation such that, $1 \le x \le y \le z \le N$ and $\gcd(x, y, z) = 1$.


For $N = 10^2$, there are three such solutions - $(1, 7, 16), (8, 9, 39), (11, 21, 72)$. So $S(10^2) = 184$.

Title: Billiard
Problem 786
Question: 
The following diagram shows a billiard table of a special quadrilateral shape.
The four angles $A, B, C, D$ are $120^\circ, 90^\circ, 60^\circ, 90^\circ$ respectively, and the lengths $AB$ and $AD$ are equal.


The diagram on the left shows the trace of an infinitesimally small billiard ball, departing from point $A$, bouncing twice on the edges of the table, and finally returning back to point $A$. The diagram on the right shows another such trace, but this time bouncing eight times:


The table has no friction and all bounces are perfect elastic collisions.
Note that no bounce should happen on any of the corners, as the behaviour would be unpredictable.


Let $B(N)$ be the number of possible traces of the ball, departing from point $A$, bouncing at most $N$ times on the edges and returning back to point $A$.


For example, $B(10) = 6$, $B(100) = 478$, $B(1000) = 45790$.

Title: Bézout's Game
Problem 787
Question: Two players play a game with two piles of stones. They take alternating turns. If there are currently $a$ stones in the first pile and $b$ stones in the second, a turn consists of removing $c\geq 0$ stones from the first pile and $d\geq 0$ from the second in such a way that $ad-bc=\pm1$. The winner is the player who first empties one of the piles.
Note that the game is only playable if the sizes of the two piles are coprime.
A game state $(a, b)$ is a winning position if the next player can guarantee a win with optimal play. Define $H(N)$ to be the number of winning positions $(a, b)$ with $\gcd(a,b)=1$, $a > 0$, $b > 0$ and $a+b \leq N$. Note the order matters, so for example $(2,1)$ and $(1,2)$ are distinct positions.
You are given $H(4)=5$ and $H(100)=2043$.

Title: Minimal Pairing Modulo $p$
Problem 789
Question: Given an odd prime $p$, put the numbers $1,...,p-1$ into $\frac{p-1}{2}$ pairs such that each number appears exactly once. Each pair $(a,b)$ has a cost of $ab \bmod p$. For example, if $p=5$ the pair $(3,4)$ has a cost of $12 \bmod 5 = 2$.
The total cost of a pairing is the sum of the costs of its pairs. We say that such pairing is optimal if its total cost is minimal for that $p$.
For example, if $p = 5$, then there is a unique optimal pairing: $(1, 2), (3, 4)$, with total cost of $2 + 2 = 4$.
The cost product of a pairing is the product of the costs of its pairs. For example, the cost product of the optimal pairing for $p = 5$ is $2 \cdot 2 = 4$.
It turns out that all optimal pairings for $p = 2\,000\,000\,011$ have the same cost product.
Find the value of this product.

Title: Clock Grid
Problem 790
Question: There is a grid of length and width 50515093 points. A clock is placed on each grid point. The clocks are all analogue showing a single hour hand initially pointing at 12.
A sequence $S_t$ is created where:
$$
\begin{align}
S_0 &= 290797\\
S_t &= S_{t-1}^2 \bmod 50515093 &t>0
\end{align}
$$
The four numbers $N_t = (S_{4t-4}, S_{4t-3}, S_{4t-2}, S_{4t-1})$ represent a range within the grid, with the first pair of numbers representing the x-bounds and the second pair representing the y-bounds. For example, if $N_t = (3,9,47,20)$, the range would be $3\le x\le 9$ and $20\le y\le47$, and would include 196 clocks.
For each $t$ $(t>0)$, the clocks within the range represented by $N_t$ are moved to the next hour $12\rightarrow 1\rightarrow 2\rightarrow \cdots $.
We define $C(t)$ to be the sum of the hours that the clock hands are pointing to after timestep $t$.
You are given $C(0) = 30621295449583788$, $C(1) =  30613048345941659$, $C(10) = 21808930308198471$ and $C(100) = 16190667393984172$.

Let $S(n)$ be the sum of all quadruples of integers $(a,b,c,d)$ satisfying $1 \leq a \leq b \leq c \leq d \leq n$ such that their average is exactly twice their variance.

Title: Card Stacking Game
Problem 798
Question: 
Two players play a game with a deck of cards which contains $s$ suits with each suit containing $n$ cards numbered from $1$ to $n$.

Before the game starts, a set of cards (which may be empty) is picked from the deck and placed face-up on the table, with no overlap. These are called the visible cards.

The players then make moves in turn.
A move consists of choosing a card X from the rest of the deck and placing it face-up on top of a visible card Y, subject to the following restrictions:

The card X then covers the card Y and replaces Y as a visible card.
The player unable to make a valid move loses and play stops.

Let $C(n, s)$ be the number of different initial sets of cards for which the first player will lose given best play for both players.

Let $b_n = \lfloor a_n / 2^{16} \rfloor \bmod 52$.
The sequence $b_0, b_1, \dots$ is translated to an infinite string $c = c_0c_1\dots$ via the rule:
$0 \rightarrow$ a, $1\rightarrow$ b, $\dots$, $25 \rightarrow$ z, $26 \rightarrow$ A, $27 \rightarrow$ B, $\dots$, $51 \rightarrow$ Z.


For example, if we choose $a_0 = 123456$, then the string $c$ starts with: "bQYicNGCY$\dots$".
Moreover, starting from index $100$, we encounter the substring "RxqLBfWzv" for the first time.


Alternatively, if $c$ starts with "EULERcats$\dots$", then $a_0$ must be $78580612777175$.


Now suppose that the string $c$ starts with "PuzzleOne$\dots$".

Title: Nim on Towers of Hanoi
Problem 806
Question: This problem combines the game of Nim with the Towers of Hanoi. For a brief introduction to the rules of these games, please refer to Problem 301 and Problem 497, respectively.
The unique shortest solution to the Towers of Hanoi problem with $n$ disks and $3$ pegs requires $2^n-1$ moves. Number the positions in the solution from index 0 (starting position, all disks on the first peg) to index $2^n-1$ (final position, all disks on the third peg).
Each of these $2^n$ positions can be considered as the starting configuration for a game of Nim, in which two players take turns to select a peg and remove any positive number of disks from it. The winner is the player who removes the last disk.
We define $f(n)$ to be the sum of the indices of those positions for which, when considered as a Nim game, the first player will lose (assuming an optimal strategy from both players).
For $n=4$, the indices of losing positions in the shortest solution are 3,6,9 and 12. So we have $f(4) = 30$.
You are given that $f(10) = 67518$.
Find $f(10^5)$. Give your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.

Title: Loops of Ropes
Problem 807
Question: Given a circle $C$ and an integer $n > 1$, we perform the following operations.
In step $0$, we choose two uniformly random points $R_0$ and $B_0$ on $C$.
In step $i$ ($1 \leq i < n$), we first choose a uniformly random point $R_i$ on $C$ and connect the points $R_{i - 1}$ and $R_i$ with a red rope; then choose a uniformly random point $B_i$ on $C$ and connect the points $B_{i - 1}$ and $B_i$ with a blue rope.
In step $n$, we first connect the points $R_{n - 1}$ and $R_0$ with a red rope; then connect the points $B_{n - 1}$ and $B_0$ with a blue rope.
Each rope is straight between its two end points, and lies above all previous ropes.
After step $n$, we get a loop of red ropes, and a loop of blue ropes.
Sometimes the two loops can be separated, as in the left figure below; sometimes they are "linked", hence cannot be separated, as in the middle and right figures below.
Let $P(n)$ be the probability that the two loops can be separated.
For example, $P(3) = \frac{11}{20}$ and $P(5) \approx 0.4304177690$.
Find $P(80)$, rounded to $10$ digits after decimal point.

Title: XOR-Primes
Problem 810
Question: We use $x\oplus y$ for the bitwise XOR of $x$ and $y$.
Define the XOR-product of $x$ and $y$, denoted by $x \otimes y$, similar to a long multiplication in base $2$, except that the intermediate results are XORed instead of the usual integer addition.
For example, $7 \otimes 3 = 9$, or in base $2$, $111_2 \otimes 11_2 = 1001_2$:
An XOR-prime is an integer $n$ greater than $1$ that is not an XOR-product of two integers greater than $1$. The above example shows that $9$ is not an XOR-prime. Similarly, $5 = 3 \otimes 3$ is not an XOR-prime. The first few XOR-primes are $2, 3, 7, 11, 13, ...$ and the 10th XOR-prime is $41$.

Title: Amidakuji
Problem 837
Question: 
Amidakuji (Japanese: 阿弥陀籤) is a method for producing a random permutation of a set of objects.

In the beginning, a number of parallel vertical lines are drawn, one for each object. Then a specified number of horizontal rungs are added, each lower than any previous rungs. Each rung is drawn as a line segment spanning a randomly select pair of adjacent vertical lines.

For example, the following diagram depicts an Amidakuji with three objects ($A$, $B$, $C$) and six rungs:

The coloured lines in the diagram illustrate how to form the permutation. For each object, starting from the top of its vertical line, trace downwards but follow any rung encountered along the way, and record which vertical we end up on. In this example, the resulting permutation happens to be the identity: $A\mapsto A$, $B\mapsto B$, $C\mapsto C$.

Let $a(m, n)$ be the number of different three-object Amidakujis that have $m$ rungs between $A$ and $B$, and $n$ rungs between $B$ and $C$, and whose outcome is the identity permutation. For example, $a(3, 3) = 2$, because the Amidakuji shown above and its mirror image are the only ones with the required property.

You are also given that $a(123, 321) \equiv 172633303 \pmod{1234567891}$.

Title: Beans in Bowls
Problem 839
Question: 
The sequence $S_n$ is defined by $S_0 = 290797$ and $S_n = S_{n - 1}^2 \bmod 50515093$ for $n > 0$.
There are $N$ bowls indexed $0,1,\dots ,N-1$. Initially there are $S_n$ beans in bowl $n$.

At each step, the smallest index $n$ is found such that bowl $n$ has strictly more beans than bowl $n+1$. Then one bean is moved from bowl $n$ to bowl $n+1$.

Let $B(N)$ be the number of steps needed to sort the bowls into non-descending order.
For example, $B(5) = 0$, $B(6) = 14263289$ and $B(100)=3284417556$.

Find $B(10^7)$.

Title: Sum of Products
Problem 840
Question: A partition of $n$ is a set of positive integers for which the sum equals $n$.
The partitions of 5 are:
$\{5\},\{1,4\},\{2,3\},\{1,1,3\},\{1,2,2\},\{1,1,1,2\}$ and $\{1,1,1,1,1\}$.


Further we define the function $D(p)$ as:
$$
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
D(1) &= 1 \\
D(p) &= 1, \text{ for any prime } p \\
D(pq) &= D(p)q + pD(q), \text{ for any positive integers } p,q \gt 1.
\end{split}
\end{align}
$$


Now let $\{a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_k\}$ be a partition of $n$.
We assign to this particular partition the value: $$P=\prod_{j=1}^{k}D(a_j). $$


$G(n)$ is the sum of $P$ for all partitions of $n$.
We can verify that $G(10) = 164$.

Title: Regular Star Polygons
Problem 841
Question: The regular star polygon $\{p/q\}$, for coprime integers $p,q$ with $p \gt 2q \gt 0$, is a polygon formed from $p$ edges of equal length and equal internal angles, such that tracing the complete polygon wraps $q$ times around the centre. For example, $\{8/3\}$ is illustrated below:
The edges of a regular star polygon intersect one another, dividing the interior into several regions. Define the alternating shading of a regular star polygon to be a selection of such regions to shade, such that every piece of every edge has a shaded region on one side and an unshaded region on the other, with the exterior of the polygon unshaded. For example, the above image shows the alternating shading (in green) of $\{8/3\}$.
Let $A(p, q)$ be the area of the alternating shading of $\{p/q\}$, assuming that its inradius is $1$. (The inradius of a regular polygon, star or otherwise, is the distance from its centre to the midpoint of any of its edges.) For example, in the diagram above, it can be shown that central shaded octagon has area $8(\sqrt{2}-1)$ and each point's shaded kite has area $2(\sqrt{2}-1)$, giving $A(8,3) = 24(\sqrt{2}-1) \approx 9.9411254970$.
You are also given that $A(130021, 50008)\approx 10.9210371479$, rounded to $10$ digits after the decimal point.
Find $\sum_{n=3}^{34} A(F_{n+1},F_{n-1})$, where $F_j$ is the Fibonacci sequence with $F_1=F_2=1$ (so $A(F_{5+1},F_{5-1}) = A(8,3)$). Give your answer rounded to $10$ digits after the decimal point.

Title: Irregular Star Polygons
Problem 842
Question: 
Given $n$ equally spaced points on a circle, we define an $n$-star polygon as an $n$-gon having those $n$ points as vertices. Two $n$-star polygons differing by a rotation/reflection are considered different.

For example, there are twelve $5$-star polygons shown below.

For an $n$-star polygon $S$, let $I(S)$ be the number of its self intersection points.
Let $T(n)$ be the sum of $I(S)$ over all $n$-star polygons $S$.
For the example above $T(5) = 20$ because in total there are $20$ self intersection points.

Some star polygons may have intersection points made from more than two lines. These are only counted once. For example, $S$, shown below is one of the sixty $6$-star polygons. This one has $I(S) = 4$.

You are also given that $T(8) = 14640$.

Problem 843
Question: 
This problem involves an iterative procedure that begins with a circle of $n\ge 3$ integers. At each step every number is simultaneously replaced with the absolute difference of its two neighbours.

For any initial values, the procedure eventually becomes periodic.

Let $S(N)$ be the sum of all possible periods for $3\le n \leq N$. For example, $S(6) = 6$, because the possible periods for $3\le n \leq 6$ are $1, 2, 3$. Specifically, $n=3$ and $n=4$ can each have period $1$ only, while $n=5$ can have period $1$ or $3$, and $n=6$ can have period $1$ or $2$.

You are also given $S(30) = 20381$.

Now we define a $k$-Markov number to be a positive integer that is part of a solution to:
Let $M_k(N)$ be the sum of $k$-Markov numbers $\le N$. Hence $M_3(10^{3})=2797$, also $M_8(10^8) = 131493335$.

Question: 
Jack has three plates in front of him. The giant has $N$ beans that he distributes to the three plates. All the beans look the same, but one of them is a magic bean. Jack doesn't know which one it is, but the giant knows.

Jack can ask the giant questions of the form: "Does this subset of the beans contain the magic bean?" In each question Jack may choose any subset of beans from a single plate, and the giant will respond truthfully.

If the three plates contain $a$, $b$ and $c$ beans respectively, we let $h(a, b, c)$ be the minimal number of questions Jack needs to ask in order to guarantee he locates the magic bean. For example, $h(1, 2, 3) = 3$ and $h(2, 3, 3) = 4$.

Let $H(N)$ be the sum of $h(a, b, c)$ over all triples of non-negative integers $a$, $b$, $c$ with $1 \leq a + b + c \leq N$.

Title: Coins in a Box
Problem 852
Question: This game has a box of $N$ unfair coins and $N$ fair coins. Fair coins have probability 50% of landing heads while unfair coins have probability 75% of landing heads.
The player begins with a score of 0 which may become negative during play.
At each round the player randomly picks a coin from the box and guesses its type: fair or unfair. Before guessing they may toss the coin any number of times; however, each toss subtracts 1 from their score. The decision to stop tossing and make a guess can be made at any time. After guessing the player's score is increased by 20 if they are right and decreased by 50 if they are wrong. Then the coin type is revealed to the player and the coin is discarded.
After $2N$ rounds the box will be empty and the game is over. Let $S(N)$ be the expected score of the player at the end of the game assuming that they play optimally in order to maximize their expected score.
You are given $S(1) = 20.558591$ rounded to 6 digits after the decimal point.

In each round Alex divides the current rectangular piece of paper into $a \times b$ pieces using $a-1$ horizontal cuts and $b-1$ vertical ones. The cuts do not need to be evenly spaced. Moreover, a piece can have zero width/height when a cut coincides with another cut or the edge of the paper. The pieces are then numbered $1, 2, ..., ab$ starting from the left top corner, moving from left to right and starting from the left of the next row when a row is finished.
Then Bianca chooses one of the pieces for the game to continue on. However, Bianca must not choose a piece with a number she has already chosen during the game.

Title: Products of Bi-Unitary Divisors
Problem 861
Question: A unitary divisor of a positive integer $n$ is a divisor $d$ of $n$ such that $\gcd\left(d,\frac{n}{d}\right)=1$.
A bi-unitary divisor of $n$ is a divisor $d$ for which $1$ is the only unitary divisor of $d$ that is also a unitary divisor of $\frac{n}{d}$.
For example, $2$ is a bi-unitary divisor of $8$, because the unitary divisors of $2$ are $\{1,2\}$, and the unitary divisors of $8/2$ are $\{1,4\}$, with $1$ being the only unitary divisor in common.
The bi-unitary divisors of $240$ are $\{1,2,3,5,6,8,10,15,16,24,30,40,48,80,120,240\}$.
Let $P(n)$ be the product of all bi-unitary divisors of $n$. Define $Q_k(N)$ as the number of positive integers $1 \lt n \leq N$ such that $P(n)=n^k$. For example, $Q_2\left(10^2\right)=51$ and $Q_6\left(10^6\right)=6189$.

Title: Different Dice
Problem 863
Question: Using only a six-sided fair dice and a five-sided fair dice, we would like to emulate an $n$-sided fair dice.
For example, one way to emulate a 28-sided dice is to follow this procedure:
The expected number of dice rolls in following this procedure is 2.142476 (rounded to 6 decimal places). Note that rolling both dice at the same time is still counted as two dice rolls.
There exist other more complex procedures for emulating a 28-sided dice that entail a smaller average number of dice rolls. However, the above procedure has the attractive property that the sequence of dice rolled is predetermined: regardless of the outcome, it follows (D5,D6,D5,D6,D6,D6,D6,...), truncated wherever the process stops. In fact, amongst procedures for $n=28$ with this restriction, this one is optimal in the sense of minimising the expected number of rolls needed.
Different values of $n$ will in general use different predetermined sequences. For example, for $n=8$, the sequence (D5,D5,D5,...) gives an optimal procedure, taking 2.083333... dice rolls on average.
Define $R(n)$ to be the expected number of dice rolls for an optimal procedure for emulating an $n$-sided dice using only a five-sided and a six-sided dice, considering only those procedures where the sequence of dice rolled is predetermined. So, $R(8) \approx 2.083333$ and $R(28) \approx 2.142476$.
Let $S(n) = \displaystyle\sum_{k=2}^n R(k)$. You are given that $S(30) \approx 56.054622$.

$$122{\color{red}555}211 \rightarrow 1{\color{red}222}11\rightarrow{\color{red}111}\rightarrow.$$
On the other hand, neither $663633$ nor $9990$ are triplicate numbers.

Let $T(n)$ be how many triplicate numbers are less than $10^n$.

For example, $T(6) = 261$ and $T(30) = 5576195181577716$.

Find $T(10^4)$. Give your answer modulo $998244353$.

Title: Tidying Up B
Problem 866
Question: 
A small child has a “number caterpillar” consisting of $N$ jigsaw pieces, each with one number on it, which, when connected together in a line, reveal the numbers $1$ to $N$ in order.

Every night, the child's father has to pick up the pieces of the caterpillar that have been scattered across the play room. He picks up the pieces at random and places them in the correct order.
As the caterpillar is built up in this way, it forms distinct segments that gradually merge together.

Any time the father places a new piece in its correct position, a segment of length $k$ is formed and he writes down the $k$th hexagonal number $k\cdot(2k-1)$. Once all pieces have been placed and the full caterpillar constructed he calculates the product of all the numbers written down. Interestingly, the expected value of this product is always an integer. For example if $N=4$ then the expected value is $994$.

Find the expected value of the product for a caterpillar of $N=100$ pieces.
Give your answer modulo $987654319$.
